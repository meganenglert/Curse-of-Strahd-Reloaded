# A1. Daggerford
## A1a. The Nightmare's Bridle TODO Clean This up

> [!info]- READ Harvesttide  
> It's the evening before Highharvesttide, and a storm has descended over Daggerford, with dark clouds pouring cascades of rain down upon the town below. Despite the weather, however, the town buzzes with anticipation of the impending falltime festival, each home filled with warmth and joy. Bright, cheery candlelight twinkles from every window, and the sounds of song and dance echo throughout the wet and muddy streets.
> 
> Amidst the merriment, however, you stand apart. Neither locals nor visitors, you're vagabonds—travelers, ghosts passing through an unfamiliar town. As laughter rings out from inns and homes, you face a simpler, starker dilemma: the quest for shelter.
> 
> Every room in this town is claimed, every hearth filled to bursting, leaving you in the grip of the bitter storm. Until, that is, the owner of the ramshackle Nightmare's Bridle tavern offers you a grudging reprieve: the hayloft above their stable. It's nothing to boast about, leaving the biting cold and the lingering scent of musty hay as your only companions. But it's a roof over your heads nonetheless—a small mercy on a night such as this.
> 
> One by one, you find a home amidst the muck and hay. Overhead, rain lashes the stable, thunder punctuating the rhythmic drumming on the roof. Flashes of lightning lance across the skies, casting the stable's interior in stark lights and darks. Rainwater drips steadily down through a leak in the roof, snaking its way across the floor until it pools in the corner.
> 
> Here, then, you find yourselves: huddled in the darkness amongst strangers, while joy and mirth dance just out of reach.

- Players introduce themselves

> [!info]- READ Daggerford Storms  
> A searing bolt of lightning rends the sky, illuminating the evening in a blinding flash of stark white. The booming thunder that follows is so loud it shakes the very ground beneath you, causing the timbers of the stable to creak and groan.
> 
> The light of the strike lingers unnaturally, silhouetting small wisps of fog that twist through the air. A thick, ankle-deep mist gathers outside, shrouding the earth in a ghostly veil. Its tendrils curl invitingly, as though beckoning you to the darkness beyond.
> 
> The rain continues to pelt the roof above, but the wind no longer howls, and the merry sounds of Daggerford's festivities seem muted and distant. The horses in the stable beneath stir uneasily, their whinnies echoing loudly in the stillness. An uneasy feeling sweeps through the hayloft, a cold shiver that has nothing to do with the wind or rain.

- ***The Stone Crest - Harmony.*** The crest emits a low hum and smells of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger when the crest is moved toward Death House.
* ***Broken Blade - Justice.*** The blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of Death House.
* ***Dragon's Scale - Inheritance.*** The scale burns icy cold, one end glowing with a bright, silver light in the direction of Death House.
* ***Sunrise Medallion - Faith.*** The medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, emitting rays of bright light in the direction of Death House.
* ***Amber Shard - Knowledge.*** The shard glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
* ***Wolf's Tooth - Healing.*** The tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
* ***Crumpled Page - Power.*** The ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that shows the page's location—and an arrow that guides toward Death House.
* ***Tattered Banner - Ambition.*** The sound of war-drums fills the air, and the banner blows in an unseen wind in the direction of Death House.
* ***Electrum Coin - Wealth.*** The coin lands on its edge and begins rolling across the muddy cobblestones in the direction of Death House.
* ***Angel's Feather - Redemption.*** The feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
* ***Raven's Feather - Duty.*** The feather is swept away by the wind, its shadow seeming to dance in the air, as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
* ***Wanderer's Scarf - Family.*** The scarf is carried away by the wind, its patterns shifting and turning in the air as it whirls through the streets toward Death House.

> [!info]- Transition to Barovia  
> You emerge from the hayloft into the swirling mists beyond, the stones of Daggerford's streets slick and gleaming beneath your feet. The city's laughter and cheer is now but a hollow echo, the brightness of its revelry drowned in the fog that encircles you. The taste of the cold, damp air is sharp on your tongue, and the sound of your own breath loud in your ears.
> 
> Your relics call you forward, the mists parting to make way. You move slowly at first, then faster, your hearts pounding in your chest. As you venture deeper into the fog, each step you make feels heavier, each echo of thunder a beat in this relentless march.
> 
> The fog swallows the town, buildings reduced to looming shadows, their shapes dancing and flickering in the storm's sporadic flashes of lightning. Rain drums a relentless rhythm, the patter of drops on cobblestone accompanying the distant, mournful peal of thunder. For brief moments, you can feel something else beneath your feet: the steady pounding of a deep and distant heartbeat.
> 
> You're pulled left, then right, then left again, the relics guiding you through the murky labyrinth. Distance and direction have lost all meaning, the shadows around you contorting in twisted shapes. Your blood sings in your ears, and the air grows denser, electric, as the energy of the storm—of the chase—swells with reckless abandon.
> 
> And then—the pounding stops.
> 
> The thunder pauses.
> 
> And the mist breaks.
> 
> The fog pulls back like a curtain, revealing a tall, eerie silhouette that towers in the gloom before you.

# A2. Death House
## A2a. The Arrival
### Area 1: Entrance

> [!info]- Death House Exterior  
> A grand manor stands before you, four stories of cold, soot-stained stone, tall narrow windows, and high peaked roofs forming a picture of austere, chilling grandeur. Midway up, a narrow balcony juts out from the third floor, offering a grim perch from which to survey the surrounding grounds.
> 
> The centerpiece of this imposing facade is the portico, a stone arch standing sentinel before the house's oaken doors. A wrought-iron gate fills this arch, its rusty hinges creaking as it sways open in the wind.
> 
> On either side of the gate, oil lamps hang from chains, their light dim and flickering, casting a sickly glow that barely pierces the surrounding fog.
> 
> Beyond the gate, a set of sturdy oaken doors stand closed, framed by the gate and the lamps. The doors are old and weathered, their wood darkened by time, but they stand strong and proud—an unwelcome entrance to the house beyond.
> 
> A gust of wind sweeps past you, carrying with it a whisper of cold dread that sends shivers down your spine.

- The house is deserted in the woods.
- Wanderer's scarf and electrum coins land on the threshold of the house.

> [!info]- Entrance Description  
> Oil lamps hang from the portico ceiling by chains, flanking a set of oaken doors that open into a grand foyer. Hanging on the south wall of the foyer is a shield emblazoned with a coat-of arms, flanked by framed portraits of stony-faced aristocrats. Mahogany-framed double doors leading deeper into the house are set with panes of stained glass.

- Look at coat of arms: a stylized golden windmill on a red field

### Area 2A: Main Hall

A wide hall (area 2A) runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a longsword (nonmagical) with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt. The wood-paneled walls are ornately sculpted with images of vines, fowers, nymphs, and satyrs. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, see serpents and skulls inconspicuously woven into the wall designs. The decorative paneling follows the staircase as it circles upward to the second floor. A cloakroom (area 2B) has several black cloaks hanging from hooks on the walls. A top hat sits on a high shelf.

> 13 Neyavr, 348  
> <em>Dinner and refreshments to be served.</em>

### Area 3: Den of Wolves

> [!info]- Entering the Den  
> As you crack the door to this room open, you catch a glimpse of something feral beyond: an amber eye that flashes in the darkness, and a bestial muzzle curled into a snarl.  
> *If they continue:*  
> The door cracks open, revealing a gray-furred wolf frozen into place. It's only a moment before you realize that it's not moving—and another before you realize that it's not alone.
> 
> This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter's den. A freshly tended fire provides the only light in the room. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag's head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are two more taxidermied wolves—a large gray wolf and a smaller brown wolf.
> 
> Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face a hearth, with an oak table between them supporting an assortment of objects. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs, and two cabinets stand against the walls. A pair of small toys seems to have been forgotten beneath one of the chairs.

- Toys (no check needed): The discarded toys are small, plush gray wolves, whose threadbare coats show evidence of heavy mending and patchwork. Clumsy stitching on their stomachs read ROSE and THORN, respectively.
- Search the room (DC 8 INT investigation check): A cabinet contains a child's needlework that depicts a boy and girl holding the hands of a young woman, alongside clumsily stitched words that read FOR MISS KLARA. The young woman's face has been slashed and cut out.
- Gray wolf seen on entrance moves when no one is looking.

### Area 4: Kitchen and Pantry

> [!info]- Entering the kitchen  
> You enter a tidy kitchen, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door.
> 
> In the front right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door set into the wall.

- Inspect the cookware - the largest kitchen knife is missing
	- General inspect the kitchen - DC 12 INT Investigation Check
- Enter the pantry: 
	- The shelves are lined with ornately decorated and pristine plates and bowls, with the exception of one plate shattered on the floor.
- Inspect the pantry shelving - find the pot 
	- Antique copper pot, holding a bottle of wine, a folded piece of delicate lace, a vial of a brown dried powder, and a bouquet of wilted sunflowers, tied with ribbon to a small scroll of parchment.
		- Look at wine label: Wizard of Wines winery, Champagne du Stomp
		- Drink wine: turned to vinegar
		- Unfold lace: find K sewn into a corner
		- DC 14 INT Nature check: brown powder is dried silphium, a contraceptive herb
		- Read the parchment: "For the light of my life. — G," and one of the knives in the kitchen flies off its shelf and embeds itself into the opposite wall.

> [!info]- The Dumbwaiter  
> You open the small door to find a narrow stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple rope and pulley mechanism that must be operated manually.  
> Hanging on the wall next to the dumbwaiter is a small brass bell.

- Small character can enter dumbwaiter with DC 10 DEX (Acrobatics) check → 200 pound weight limit before breaking

### Area 5: Dining Room

> [!info]- Entering the Dining Room  
> *Approaching*  
> You faintly hear noise that sounds like a lively dinner party, with many overlapping conversations, glasses clinking, and rowdy laughter. You smell a delicious feast.  
> *Upon Entering*  
> As you turn the knob, the noise stops. All you can hear now is silence.
> 
> You enter into a wood-paneled dining room, with no traces of the raucous party in sight. The centerpiece is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is set with resplendent silverware and crystal glasses polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.
> 
> The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.
> 
> The table groans beneath the weight of a delicious-looking feast, still steaming hot. Exquisite dishes lay on grand platters: succulent roasted poultry glazed with a shimmering honey sauce, perfectly grilled cuts of beef still steaming lightly, a variety of cheeses and fresh fruits, and freshly baked breads giving off a comforting aroma.

- Search the walls: DC 12 WIS Perception to see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks, with wolves lurking amid the carved foliage.

## A2c. The Second Floor
### Area 6: Upper Hall

> [!info]- The Upper Hall  
> Unlit oil lamps are mounted on the walls of this elegant hall. Hanging above the mantelpiece is a wood-framed portrait of the Durst family: Gustav and Elisabeth Durst with their two smiling children, Rose and Thorn. ==The caption reads: *Mr. Gustav and Mrs. Elizabeth Durst with their two children, Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst, 357.*== Standing suits of armor flank wooden doors in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. The doors around you are carved with dancing youths.  
> The red marble staircase that started on the first floor continues its upward spiral to [[#Balcony]]. A cold draft can be felt coming down the steps.

- Look at the door: successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the youths aren't really dancing but fighting off swarms of bats. 

### Area 7: Servants' Room

> [!info]- Entering the servants' room  
> This undecorated bedroom contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is a closed foot locker. A door to the left appears to lead to a closet.
> 
> In the right-hand corner stands a small wooden door, a metal button set into the wall beside it. A basket full of unwashed laundry appears to have been left beside it.

- Search the basket: a man's laundry, including fine suits, neckties, pants, and stockings. However, a much smaller woman's slip appears to have been mixed in with the rest.
- Press the button: Bell rings in the kitchen
- Closet contains tidy servants' uniforms

### Area 8: The Library

> [!info]- Entering the library  
> Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this room. An exquisite mahogany desk and a matching high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Situated in corners of the room are two overstuffed chairs.
> 
> Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall. A rolling wooden ladder allows one to more easily reach the high shelves.

*the desk*
- Look on top of the desk: find a handwritten note (from Klara)
- Search in the desk's drawers: find receipts for candles, daggers, and incense  
*the bookshelves*
- a rock collection with stones labelled
- The Tale of -----: To everyone else it appears blank, but tells the story of the player's life
	- Book ends with: *----- pulled the book down from the shelf and began to read, unaware of the creature that watched them from the shadows. Slowly, the beast began to creep forward*
	- The next page is blank, save for a bloodstain.
- Search the room: No evidence of any lurking monster
- DC 15 WIS Perception searching the room: Can see flickering candle light emanating from beneath the secret door  
*the secret door*
- unless already opened from waltz for clara, DC 13 WIS Perception check lets a player spot a fake book with a blank spine when searching the shelf

> [!info]- behind the bookshelf  
> Behind the bookshelf is a blank wall, save for a small niche made of dark wood with a faint amber glow. The cubby is about 1 foot tall, 3 inches wide, and the recess extends only about two inches beyond the surface of the wall. There is a worn, silver hook mounted at the top of the niche.

> [!info]- if they try josh's shard  
> the niche glows slightly brighter for an instant, before returning to it former state.

### Area 9: The Secret Room

> [!info]- entering the secret room  
> This small hidden room is packed with bookshelves groaning with old and ominous-looking leather-bound tomes. A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest, its ribs and head caught beneath the lid, is a skeleton in leather armor.

Inspect the chest: The chest contains three blank books with black leather > covers (worth 25 gp each), three spell scrolls (bless, protection from poison, and spiritual weapon), the deed to the house, and a signed will. The will is signed by Gustav and Elizabeth and bequeathes the house and all other family property to Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst in the event of their parents' death.

> [!info]- strahd letter  
> My most pathetic servant,
> 
> I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the one who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but a worm writhing in my earth.
> 
> You say that you are cursed, your fortune spent. Your husband took solace in the bosom of another woman, sired a bastard son, and drove you to abandon love for madness. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.
> 
> Your dread lord and master,
> 
> Strahd von Zarovich

### Area 10: The Conservatory

> [!info]- Entering the conservatory  
> You enter into an elegantly appointed hall, the windows of which are covered by gossamer drapes. A brass-plated chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and upholstered chairs line the walls. Above a warm, crackling fireplace, a shelf holds elegant alabaster figurines dancing.
> 
> Several stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments. A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. As you look away to survey the rest of your surroundings, you see a flash of movement, but all is still when your gaze returns to the instruments.

- Investigate the harpsichord: see that a key is stuck in the "down" position
	- EITHER player asks to look inside the harpsichord → no check needed 
	- or succeed on DC 15 INT investigation check
	- to find a rolled-up piece of parchment tucked beneath one of the strings
	- Read the parchment: handwritten sheet music for the harpsichord titled *Waltz for Klara*
	- Attempt to play it – either be Zoe or DC 15 CHA performance check

> [!info]- the Waltz for Klara  
> As you press your fingers to the keys, the notes echo, a haunting melody filling the quiet, dusty room. As you continue to play, the music seems to take on a life of its own, your hands moving across the keys unbidden as if guided by an unseen force.
> 
> From the edges of the room, spectral figures begin to materialize, spinning and weaving in a ghostly dance as though led by the song. Most are unfamiliar to you, but you recognize two: Elisabeth Durst, in the corner, watching Gustav's apparition dancing with a beautiful young woman wearing humble clothes.
> 
> The eyes of Elisabeth's apparition narrow into a cold, furious stare. The dancers pay her little heed, however, the song growing faster as the spirits whirl to the rhythm of the harpsichord's crescendo.
> 
> With a swift movement, Elisabeth reaches for a pendant around her spectral neck—a shimmering amber shard hung on a cord of ethereal mist (IF JOSH IS IN THE ROOM:), which Ari recognizes looks much like his own. As Elisabeth's ghostly fist curls around the pendant, her eyes flash a bright, menacing amber—and the spectral dancers dissipate, swept away as if by an unseen wind.
> 
> Elisabeth's apparition lingers but a moment longer before disappearing with the rest. As it does, a sound resonates through the room: the low sound of scraping wood, originating from the room across the hall. The floor trembles faintly—and you hear a crash from the mantelpiece. Two of the alabaster figurines have fallen from their place on the shelf: one, toppled over on its side; the other, shattered across the floor.

## A2d. The Third Floor
### Area 11: Balcony

> [!info]- entering the balcony  
> You climb the red marble staircase to its full height, arriving at a dusty balcony. The air here is dry and musty, but tinged with a strange, coppery scent.
> 
> A suit of black plate armor stands against one wall, draped in cobwebs and marked by age. Oil lamps are mounted on the faded oak-paneled walls, which are carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny beasts.

fall over the balcony → 20 feet, 2d6 bludgeoning

### Area 12: Master Suite

> [!info]- approaching the door  
> These grand doors loom tall, their dark wood frames enclosing a pair of dusty stained-glass windows. Each pane is etched with intricate designs that resemble windmills, their once-vibrant hues now faded and obscured beneath a thick veil of grime.
> 
> Through the dusty haze that prickles your eyes, you catch a glimpse of something through the windows: a silhouette, standing mere inches behind the glass, lit from behind by a dim, amber glow. It's still and unmoving, but the mere sight of it seizes your muscles in a vice-like grip, your limbs refusing to obey your conscious mind.
> 
> The air around you thickens, its temperature plummeting to a bone-chilling cold. Your breath fogs the glass panes, a delicate frost creeping across them as the house's distant creaks and whispers are swallowed by a heavy silence.
> 
> The shadow behind the door is nearly formless—insubstantial—but its presence invokes a primordial dread deep within your marrow. Your heart beats faster, sweat beading on your forehead, pulse racing through your veins. Slowly, the silhouette begins to turn its head toward yours.
> 
> And then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the shadow evaporates. The biting cold ebbs away, and the house's quiet sounds return once more.

> [!info]- entering  
> You enter a dusty, cobweb-filled master bedroom with burgundy drapes covering the windows. A four-poster bed with embroidered curtains and tattered gossamer veils stands against the center wall.
> 
> A door facing the foot of the bed has a faded full-length mirror mounted on it. In the right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door, its surface half-rotted by age. A tarnished metal button is set into the wall beside it.
> 
> A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of the man and woman from the first-floor portrait hanging above it. A web-filled parlor in the southwest corner contains two chairs and a table holding several items, as well as a door with a dark, dirt-flecked window.
> 
> The room also contains a matching pair of wardrobes, a padded chair, and a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and a silver jewelry box. A soft amber glow emanates from beneath the jewelry box's lid.

***The Bed.*** A player that approaches the bed can see that a large, bloodstained kitchen knife has been driven into one of the pillows.

***The Jewelry Box.*** ~~~The jewelry box is empty of valuables. Instead, it is filled with grain, with an *amber shard* resting in the center of the box. (This amber shard is the unique key to the secret door in the [[#Library]].) 

done elizabeth has it

A roll of parchment is half-buried in the grain beside the shard. If unfurled, it reads as follows:  
this is the invitation but now it's to an anniversary party

***The Bed.*** A player that approaches the bed can see that a large, bloodstained kitchen knife has been driven into one of the pillows.

***The Balcony.*** A player that exits the bedroom onto the balcony sees only a wall of fleshy tendrils encompassing the exterior of the house. The tendrils are as described in [[#Main Hall]].

### Area 13: Bathroom
This dark room contains a wooden tub with clawed feet, a small iron stove with a kettle resting atop it, and a barrel under a spigot in the east wall. A cistern on the roof used to collect rainwater, which was borne down a pipe to the spigot; however, the plumbing no longer works.

### Area 14: Storage Room

> [!info]- enter  
> Dusty shelves line the walls of this room. A few of the shelves have folded sheets, blankets, and old bars of soap on them. A cobweb-covered broom leans against the far wall.

### Area 15: Nursemaid's Suite

> [!info]- entering the nursemaid's suite  
> Dust and cobwebs shroud this elegantly appointed bedroom. A large bed stands against the far wall, its once-opulent coverings now faded and threadbare.
> 
> Beside the bed, a mildew-covered towel covers most of a dusty yellowed book on one of its two end tables. On the far side of the room, you can see a pair of two more stained-glass doors, their windows flecked with dirt and grime.
> 
> To the left stands an empty wardrobe, its doors slightly ajar. Mounted beside it stands a full-length mirror, its wooden frame carved to resemble ivy and berries.
> 
> To the right, there is a closed door.

*The bed* appears to have been made in a hurry – the blanket is laid atop a set of rumpled sheets, which is no way a respectable nursemaid would leave her room.

***The Doors.*** A player that exits the bedroom through the stained-glass doors and onto the balcony sees only a wall of fleshy tendrils encompassing the exterior of the house. The tendrils are as described in [[#Main Hall]].

***The Book.*** The book is a cobwebbed copy of a raunchy romance novel titled *Blue-Blooded Lips*. It tells the story of a peasant woman's romance with a wealthy duke.

***The Nursery.*** As a player approaches the door to the nursery, the ghost of Klara appears near the entrance of the bedroom (effectively blocking them in). She says "Don't be too loud, he just fell asleep."

> [!profile]- Miss Klara, the Nursemaid
> - I played her as tragic and shy, pressing her beautiful, ghostly form into the corner of her room in order to hide from the party. Margaret is a very confused ghost. She knows that something bad happened to her, but she doesn't actually remember dying. In fact, she frequently jumps between knowing and not knowing she's dead, between past and present.
> - Margaret speaks fondly of Mr. Durst, saying that he's a very kind man, but doesn't mention their affair out of propriety. If the players ask her outright about Walter being her child or of her relationship with Mr. Durst, she tells them, "It's not my place to speak of such things. I'm very sorry…" She also smiles beautifully if asked about Rose, Thorne, or Walter, claiming them all to be wonderful children. It should be obvious that she loves them very much.
> - If the characters ask Margaret about Mrs. Durst, her smile fades. She doesn't say anything outright bad about her mistress, but players should be able to sense from her mannerisms and answers that Margaret is actually afraid of Mrs. Durst.

Upon opening the door, you can see a bundle resting in a crib made of carved wood. It pulses gently, like the breathing of a sleeping child.
- If player turns away to leave, Klara says "Don't you want to meet Walter?"
- If a player tries to leave without unwrapping the bundle, the door slams shut behind them and locks, and Klara is nowhere to be seen or heard.
- If a player approaches the crib, Klara simply asks them to be quiet since the baby is sleeping. When the players approach the bundle in the crib, it unfurls revealing nothing but the cloth and Klara is gone.  
DC 15 Perception check: Find the secret door behind the mirror, revealing a cobweb-filled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.

## A2e. The Attic
### Area 16: Attic Hall

> [!info]- into the attic  
> This bare hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. Several doors lead from this attic corridor, including a door held shut with a padlock.  
> A low creak cuts through the air as one of the unlocked doors slowly creaks open.

spare bedroom door opens

### Area 17: Spare Bedroom

> [!info]- entering the spare bedroom  
> This cold, dust-choked room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a small iron stove, a writing desk with a stool, an empty wardrobe, and a rocking chair. A frowning doll in a lacy yellow dress sits in the northern window box beside a tarnished old music box, cobwebs draping it like a wedding veil.

- doll is the same doll that Rose was holding in the family portrait
- The music box contains a rusted, bloodstained knife as well as a key.
- It also has two pieces of parchment #TODO make this
	- The first parchment shows a basic floor plan split into three rectangles labeled QUARTERS, SHRINE, and ALTAR. QUARTERS and SHRINE are connected at the top by a single line, and at the bottom by a double line, which connects both to ALTAR. The second parchment contains a list of unfamiliar names beneath the word RECRUITMENT.
- as the players file out, the rocking chair starts to rock, stopping only when the door is shut and the music box is back in its place

### Area 18: Storage

> [!info]- entering the storage room  
> This dusty chamber is packed with lumpy, squat shapes draped in dusty white sheets. An old iron stove stands against the right-side wall, next to what looks to be a large trunk covered by a sheet.

- Investigate the corpse: they see that the front of her dress has multiple stab wounds, indicating her murder. 
	- A player inspecting the remains feels a cold breath on their shoulder and the unshakeable sense of being watched.
	- Meanwhile, if another player has previously uncovered a nearby mirror from its sheet covering, that player can see an apparition of Elisabeth Durst within the mirror staring at the player near the chest. Once observed, the apparition swiftly vanishes.

**_Milestone_**. Descending into Death House's dungeon level completes a story milestone. When the party gains access to the secret stairs, award each player 200 XP.

### Area 19: Guest Bedroom

> [!info]- entering the guest bedroom  
> This web-filled room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a rocking chair, an empty wardrobe, and a small iron stove. A suitcase sits on the bed, open, with clothes spilling out around it.

Search the suitcase to find this note - 

> My dear Mrs. Petrovna,  
> Your advice on dealing with the unwanted fiend in my home is very good advice indeed. Tonight's ceremony will proceed as planned when the moon is at its highest peak - without, of course, the attendance of Mr. Durst. I must agree with you that, yes, with such an innocent sacrifice our proceedings may have better results. Although, "innocent" is not quite the term I would use.  
> My Thanks,  
> Mrs. Elisabeth Durst

### Area 20: Children's Bedroom

> [!info]- entering  
> This room contains a bricked-up window flanked by two dusty, wood-framed beds sized for children. Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that's a perfect replica of the dreary edifice in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs. Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons wearing tattered but familiar clothing. 

The smaller of the two cradles a stuffed doll that you also recognize.

- Once the characters discover the children's remains, Rose and Thorne will reappear with memories far more intact. They'll also actually look like ghosts this time, spectral and see-through. At this point, they'll recall that they were often locked away when their parents went to "deal with the monster" and that the last time, no one came back for them. They were "so very hungry, but no one came when we cried. And then the hunger went away and we grew very cold and went to sleep."
- The final conversation with Rose and Thorne's ghosts in the attic should have the children implore the players for help yet again. They remember much more this time around, but they're still ignorant to the true nature of their parents. However, Rose thinks that their mother might have taken Walter to the basement last. She asks the players to save their baby brother and their parents and defeat the monster once and for all. If asked how to get into the basement, Rose points at the dollhouse revealing the secret entry.

> [!info]- the doll house  
> In life, Rose was a budding wizard who discovered a small spellbook in her father's library, and took great care in copying the _mending_, _light_, and _shocking grasp_ cantrips into her diary.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/49bvms/notes_from_running_death_house/">4</a></sup>  
> As the ghost children speak with the players, Thorn levitates one of his toys into the air, which falls and breaks. Rose swiftly uses her _mending_ spell to repair it. If her use of magic is remarked upon, she shyly shares her diary's location, which can be found hidden in the cobweb-covered pillowcase on her bed.  
> In addition to her cantrips, Rose's aged and faded diary also contains entries regarding her studies, her friends, her younger brother, her nursemaid ("Miss Klara"), and arguments between her mother and father. (Rose doesn't know anything about the content of those fights.)  
> Rose knows the way down to the basement, but "isn't supposed to go down there." If the party convinces her to show them the way, she points them toward the dollhouse, revealing the secret entry. In exchange, she asks the players to take her and Thorn's bones with them when they escape, burying them in the garden outside.  
> The dollhouse contains small dolls that depict tiny, twisted molds of any characters and creatures currently visible in the house. The dolls are made of painted resin. Any character looking inside the dollhouse while in Rose and Thorn's room can see the appropriately-placed dolls of all living creatures within the manor. The dollhouse only contains rooms within the house itself, and does not depict the dungeon levels below.  
> When the secret door is revealed, Thorn shyly asks the players if he and Rose can accompany them downstairs to aid them, and attempts to possess a friendly player if permitted. When Rose or Thorn attempts to possess a player, describe it as "a child's tiny hand, desperately seeking the touch of another soul."  
> A player possessed by Rose can cast the cantrips in her diary, while a player possessed by Thorn can gain the effects of the _mage hand_ cantrip as an action, without the use of components. (The spectral hand is invisible.)

### Area 21: Secret Stairs

Once the players have found the secret door in the dollhouse, opening the secret door reveals only a stone slab on the opposite side, inset with a small bronze panel at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche identical to the one in the library lies at the panel's center, emanating a faint amber glow. When the niche is exposed, the amber shard from the [[#Master Suite]] glimmers faintly and swings in the air toward it, as though held aloft by an unseen force.

To allow the stone slab to swing open and reveal the hidden stairs on the opposite side, the players must place the amber shard into the niche.

> [!example]- secret stairs secret door  
> The secret door opens to reveal a narrow spiral staircase built of aged-looking wood within a tight shaft of mortared stone. Thick cobwebs fill the staircase as it descends into the darkness below.

### Area 22: Dungeon Level Access

> [!example]- descending the stairs  
> The broken cobwebs around you sway like a gossamer wedding veil, beckoning you forward as the ancient stairs creak and groan underfoot. The gaping maw of the stairwell draws you deeper, swallowing you up as you descend further down its gullet. You descend one floor—two floors—three.
> 
> The walls of the stone shaft narrow around you, forcing you to hunch your shoulders and pull in your elbows to continue downward. In the darkness, you can only hear the shuffle of your feet, the choking groan of the stairs, and the pounding of your blood in your ears.
> 
> Finally, after what feels like hours, the descent levels out, and the spiral staircase ends at a darkened landing of packed earth. A narrow tunnel supported by aged timber braces stretches ahead of you, its stone walls seeming to bleed with deposits of streaked, red clay. Eight feet ahead, the tunnel splits, branching to the left and right.
> 
> As your eyes and ears adjust to the cold, subterranean corridor, you notice that the tunnel isn't as silent as the staircase above. An eerie, low-pitched sound echoes through the space—and you soon recognize it as a deep, incessant chanting.

At the bottom of the stairs is area 22.

## A2f. The Basement

### Area 23: Family Crypts
Each crypt is sealed with a stone slab unless noted otherwise. Removing a slab from its fitting requires a DC 15 STR Athletics check – Crowbar or similar grants advantage.

> [!example]- Approaching the empty crypt and walter's crypt  
> This side-corridor branches again to the left and right. On either side, large standing stone slabs have been set aside to lean against the walls, opening the way to a pair of dark, quiet crypts. The slab to the right is etched with the name "Walter Durst"; the slab to the left is blank.

> [!example]- Enter the empty crypt  
> You peer past the leaning stone slab to see an empty earthen crypt.

> [!example]- Enter Walter's crypt  
> Swollen, bloody cysts cover the walls of this crypt like tumors. From time to time, they pulsate and burst, streams of pus oozing down to collect on the floor. In the distance, you can hear an infant's quiet whimpers.

> [!example]- Approaching Gustav and Elisabeth's crypts  
> This side corridor branches again to the left and right. Large standing stone slabs seal the entrance to the tunnels on either side, blocking the way forward. The slab to the left is etched with the name "Gustav Durst"; the slab to the right is etched with the name "Elisabeth Durst." The tunnel here is unnaturally quiet, and a thin mist clings to the floor

> [!example]- Entering Gustav's crypt  
> The crypt beyond the slab contains a stone coffin lying atop a dusty stone bier. Silence hangs heavy over the lonely chamber.

> [!example]- Entering Elisabeth's crypt  
> A thick, acrid miasma hangs over the interior of this crypt, which holds a stone-carved coffin resting atop a stone bier. The floor before it is littered with the bodies of hundreds of dead termites. Many cling to the elongated, bloated body of a dead termite queen, while others appear to have died atop the scarred, mutilated bodies of four larger beetles not far away.  
> **** If coffin is disturbed:**** Swarm of insects (centipedes) boils out of the back wall and attacks

> [!example]- Approaching Rose and Thorn's Crypts  
> This side-corridor branches again to the left and right. Large standing stone slabs seal the entrance to the tunnels on either side, blocking the way forward. The slab to the left is etched with the name "Rosavalda Durst"; the slab to the right is etched with the name "Thornboldt Durst." Each slab exudes the silence of a forgotten grave.

> [!example]- Entering either crypt  
> This small chamber contains a stone coffin resting on a stone bier. The air in this crypt hangs heavy with sorrow.

### Area 24: Cult Initiates' Quarters

> [!example]- Entering the quarters.  
> A wooden table and four chairs stand at the east end of this room. To the west are four alcoves containing moldy straw pallets.

Once characters move to descend to Area 25, a sudden splashing sound can be heard before quickly subsiding.

### Area 25: Well & Cultist Quarters

> [!example]- Entering cultist quarters  
> The ceiling of this dark, earthen chamber rises a foot higher than the cramped tunnel. It's supported by thick wooden posts and cross beams that have rotted with age and bear deep holes indicative of hungry insects.
> 
> Here, a lonely well stands at the center of the room, surrounded on three sides by several smaller, alcove-like chambers that have been carved into the walls. Old footprints criss-cross the floor, leading into the alcoves, around the well, up a staircase on the other end of the room, and back upstairs the way you came.
> 
> An old hempen rope attached to a rusted pulley descends past the mouth of the well, swaying gently in the stagnant air as if just abandoned by an unseen occupant.

**The Well**. 4 foot diameter well shaft with 3 foot tall stone lip, descending 30 feet to a water-filled cistern. 
- Wooden bucket hangs from rope and pulley mechanism bolted to the cross beams above the well
- Shaft interior is covered with ash-black species of fungi.
- If players toss an object down the well and turn away, they hear loud splashing and tearing sounds from below. When they turn back, the object sits damp hanging in the bucket, torn to pieces with large parts missing.

**The Chests**. Each chest has a rusty iron padlock that can be picked with thieves' tools and DC 15 DEX check.
- *25A*. 11 gold and 60 silver in a mysterious, leathery pouch.
- *25B.* Three moss agates in a folded piece of black cloth (worth 10 gold each).
- *25C.* Black leather eyepatch with a carnelian embroidered into it (worth 50 gold).
- *25D.* Ivory hairbrush with silver bristles (worth 25 gold).
- *25E.* The cultists' logbook: A book bound in grimy black leather. This journal, which one of the cultists kept as a log of the cult's victims, contains a list of names and physical descriptions associated with each name. Each entry includes gruesome details describing the victim's sacrifice, such as "struggled profusely" or "no sedative given."

### Area 26: Hidden Spiked Pit

> [!example]- Entering from **WELL & CULTIST QUARTERS**  
> The staircase leads to a quiet landing. To the front, the stairs continue upward and vanish around a bend. To the right, the landing continues straight into a lonely corridor. This tunnel hallway seems surprisingly clean and bereft of debris; at its far end, another earthen staircase descends into darkness.
> 
> The incessant chanting that has filled the air of this underground complex grows stronger toward the far end of this corridor. Its source seems to lie beyond the descending stairs.

> [!example]- Entering from **DINING HALL**  
> The staircase descends to a quiet landing. To the front, the stairs continue to descend, opening into a broader chamber. To the left, the landing continues straight into a lonely corridor. This tunnel hallway seems surprisingly clean and bereft of debris; at its far end, another earthen staircase descends into darkness.
> 
> The incessant chanting that has filled the air of this underground complex grows stronger toward the far end of this corridor.

> [!example]- Entering from **GHOULISH ENCOUNTER**  
> The staircase descends to a quiet landing. To the left, the stairs continue to descend, rounding a bend before vanishing into darkness. The incessant chanting that has filled the air of this underground complex appears to be echoing from below.
> 
> To the right, the landing continues straight into a lonely corridor. This tunnel hallway seems surprisingly clean and bereft of debris; at its far end, the corridor branches left and right.

DC 15 WIS Perception check: Footprints litter the dungeon, but here, there seem to be none.

- Trap is 5 feet long, 10 feet deep, with wooden stakes at the bottom.
- It is covered in rotting wood planks and dirt.
- The first character to step on the cover falls through, landing prone and taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall, plus 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes.

### Area 27: Dining Hall

> [!example]- Entering the Dining Hall  
> This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. Moldy bones lie strewn on the dirt floor. A thick stench of rot and gore fills the chamber, so coppery with blood that you can taste it on your tongue.  
> Deeper into the room, there is a dark alcove, too shadowed to make out anything that may be waiting there.

### Area 28: Larder

> [!example]- Approaching the Larder  
> The alcove is empty except for a crumpled note on the ground. It reads:
> 
> > Drasha,  
> > I have selected you as the Beast's custodian in my absence. Should the Beast grow unruly or show signs of agitation while I am away, I have left behind my amber shard to weaken it and soothe its fury.  
> > Should the need arise, present the shard and speak the Beast's name to quiet its tantrums—but be sure to begone from the house before it awakens at midnight.  
> > So long as the Beast draws breath, it—not you—is the heart of this house, and no meal shall ever sate its appetite. Should you linger in its domain, it will mean doom for you all.  
> > Elisabeth

### Area 29: Ghoulish Encounter

> [!example]- Approaching the encounter  
> A deathly stench emanates from this corridor. The stone walls bear cracked, red stains, and a trail of old bones leads deeper down the tunnel.

When a player first enters one of the 5-foot squares at the entrance of the corridors (marked T on the map), four **ghouls** rise up out of the ground in the spaces marked G and attack.

> [!example]- Continuing down the corridor  
> The trail ends at the center of a quiet intersection. The incessant chanting you've heard since first entering the dungeon is noticeably louder down the northern branch of the intersection.

### Area 30: Stairs Down

> [!example]- Approaching the stairs down  
> A dark set of chiseled stone steps descends into darkness. It's clear that the origin of the muffled chanting you've been hearing lies below.

The stairs down lead to **Area 35: Reliquary**.

### Area 31: Darklord's Shrine

> [!example]- Entering the shrine  
> This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls, their mouths hanging open in silent screams.
> 
> A wide alcove in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a voluminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands beside him. The statue's right hand holds a smoky-gray crystal orb, and its painted gaze stares down toward you, a cold and cruel glint to its eye.
> 
> Five ashen shadows are burned into the walls, with soot marks stretching across the floor toward the statue.
> 
> The room has exits to the west and north. Chanting can be heard coming from the west.

- Approach the orb: Hear many voices whispering "His gaze burns upon us" and "the Darklord's eyes are always watching."
	- Player's shadow becomes blurred as it writhes in pain on the floor behind them.
- Touch the orb: feels as though a "dark, ancient evil" has suddenly turned its eye upon them
- Take the orb (god don't): Six shadows materialize around the statue and begin to attack. 
	- Try to flee: the shadows pursue.
	- Return the orb: the shadows vanish.

**Concealed Door.** DC 10 WIS Perception to spot the concealed door in the middle of the east wall. It is an ordinary but rotten wood door, hidden under a layer of clay. The door pulls open to reveal a stone staircase that climbs 10 feet to a landing.

### Area 32: Hidden Trapdoor

> [!example]- The hidden trapdoor  
> The clay staircase ends at a cramped landing. Six feet above the ground, a half-rotted ceiling of close-fitting planks holds a closed wooden trapdoor leading to an upper floor. 

It connects to the Wolf's Den. Hooray.

### Area 33: Cult Leaders' Den

> [!example]- Entering the cult leaders' den  
> This quiet room contains a wooden table flanked by two high-backed chairs and holding a clay jug and two flagons. Above the table is suspended an unlit cast-iron chandelier. Iron candlesticks stand in two corners of the chamber, their candles long since melted away. A short corridor at the north end of the room leads to a darkened chamber beyond.

On the table lies a crumpled piece of paper, seemingly balled up in a fit of rage.

> [!info]- Strahd's letter  
> My most pathetic servant,
> 
> I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the one who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but a worm writhing in my earth.
> 
> You say that you are cursed, your fortune spent. Your husband took solace in the bosom of another woman, sired a bastard son, and drove you to abandon love for madness. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.
> 
> Your dread lord and master,
> 
> Signed by a name none of you recognize

### Area 34: Cult Leader's Quarters

> [!example]- Entering the cult leaders' quarters  
> This room contains a large wood-framed bed, the feather mattress rotted by years of disuse. An old wooden wardrobe carved with demonic faces stands against the wall to the left, and a faded wooden footlocker stands quietly at the foot of the bed.
> 
> The room is suffused with a familiar stench of death—but far stronger, mixing with a noxious scent that fills your lungs with every breath.

> [!example]- Gustav's body  
> Upon closer look, you realize that, tucked into the sheets on top of the feathered mattress, there is a skeleton, wearing the tatters of what might have once been a suit.  
> You barely have a moment to think before a ghast dressed in a black cloak bursts forth from one of the walls. Her lips and gums have gone black with rot, and she smiles madly at you. "Elisabeth Durst," she says. "It's been so long since we've had guests." She holds out her hand.

Unless they totally play along with her, she lashes out with her claws. She fights until defeated.

> [!example]- Elisabeth defeated  
> As you watch the ghast break down to the floor, you notice that Gustav's skeleton is gone. In its place is a sealed envelope.  
> My Beloved Children,
> 
> I wish I could do what all fathers do and tell you that monsters aren't real. But it wouldn't be true.
> 
> Life can create things of exquisite beauty. But it can also twist them into hideous beings. Selfish. Violent. Grotesque. Monstrous. It hurts me to say that your mother has turned into one such monster, inside and out. And I'm afraid the disease that afflicted her mind has taken hold of me as well.
> 
> It sickens me to think what we've put you through. There is no excuse. I only ask of you, though I know I do not have the right to do so, to try and forgive us. I despise what your mother has become, but I love and pity her all the same.
> 
> Rose, I wish I could see you blossom into a strong, beautiful woman. Thorne, Walter, I wish I could be there for you. But I can't. This is the only way.
> 
> Goodbye.
> 

**Treasure.** The footlocker (unlocked) contains:
- Folded cloak of protection
- A mess kit
- A chain shirt
- A small wooden coffer (unlocked) contains 4 potions of healing
- A flask of alchemist's fire
- A bullseye lantern
- A set of thieves' tools
- and a spellbook with a yellow leather cover containing the following wizard spells:
	- Level 1. Disguise self, identify, mage armor, magic missile, protection from evil and good
	- Level 2. Darkvision, hold person, invisibility, magic weapon.

**Wardrobe.** Contains several old, black robes, a pair of iron candlesticks, and an open crate containing 30 torches, and a leather sack with 15 candles inside it.

### Area 35: Reliquary

> [!example]- Entering the reliquary  
> The dusty stone steps descend past a landing and around a bend until they end at a cold, rectangular chamber. A thin, wafting mist clings to the ground, and the wooden cross beams that support the ceiling groan beneath the weight of the house and underground complex above.
> 
> The walls of this room are cut with small, chiseled alcoves, each holding a strange, ghastly trinket or relic. A corridor with a sagging ceiling exits the chamber and bends out of sight to the right. Past it, you can see a stone slope that descends into black, murky water. The ghostly chant you've heard since entering the basement is strongest here, and seems to be emanating from the other side of a rusted, closed portcullis.
> 
> You can finally understand the words.
> 
> They say, over and over again, in a ceaseless refrain:
> 
> "He is the Ancient."
> 
> "He is the Land."

**The Relics.**
- A small, mummified, yellow hand with sharp claws (a goblin's hand) on a loop of rope
- A knife carved from a human bone
- A dagger with a rat's skull set into the pommel 50gp
- An 8-inch-diameter varnished orb made from a nothic's eye 20gp
- An aspergillum carved from bone
- A folded cloak made from stitched ghoul skin
- A desiccated frog lashed to a stick (could be mistaken for a wand of polymorph)
- A bag full of bat guano
- A hag's severed finger
- A 6-inch-tall wooden figurine of a mummy, its arms crossed over its chest
- An iron pendant adorned with a devil's face
- The shrunken, shriveled head of a halfling
- A small wooden coffer containing a dire wolf's withered tongue  

The southernmost tunnel slopes down at a 20-degree angle into murky water and ends at a rusty portcullis (area 37).

### Area 36: Prison

> [!example]- Entering the prison  
> The sound of clinking chains melds with a quiet, near-imperceptible rustling as you round the bend into a long, darkened dungeon. Rusted shackles hang patiently from the walls, as if waiting to grip prisoners' flesh once more.

**Secret Door.** DC 15 WIS Perception check finds a secret door on the south wall that pulls open to reveal area 38 beyond.

**Treasure.** Hanging on the back wall of the cell X on the map is a human skeleton clad in a tattered black robe. The skeleton belongs to a cult member who questioned the cult's blind devotion to Strahd. Characters who search the skeleton find a gold ring (worth 25 gp) on one of its bony fingers.

### Area 37: Portcullis

> [!example]- In the portcullis corridor  
> The floor is submerged beneath two feet of dark, murky water that sloshes around your calves and boots. The tunnel forward is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis. Beyond its iron bars, you can make out the dark outline of a half-submerged chamber, a raised stone dais, and a thick cloud of rolling mist.

- DC 20 STR Athletics check to lift open the gate - it drops back down after letting go.
- OR open with wheel within Area 38, which will keep it open.

### Area 38: Ritual Chamber
**u/MandyMod's Final Encounter**

> [!example]- Entering the ritual chamber  
> The smooth masonry walls of this forty-foot-square room make even the splash of the water boom. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais that also rises above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood. A small, white bundle lies atop it.
> 
> As soon as you step foot into the chamber, the ghostly chanting you've heard suddenly falls silent.

> [!info]- Ritual chamber dimensions
> - Water is 2 ft deep
> - Ledges and central dais are 5 feet tall (3 feet out of the water)
> - Ceiling 16 ft tall, 11 above the dais
> - Ceiling chains 8 ft tall (3 feet above dais)
> - East wall has the wheel for the portcullis – costs one action to turn (either raise or lower)

IF NO ONE IS APPROACHING THE DAMN DAIS: It's relic time baby.

> [!example]- Approaching the dais  
> As you climb onto the dais and cautiously approach the altar, you notice that the words "FEED HIM" are carved into the flat stone surface just beneath the infant-sized white bundle.  

Grab the bundle and/or open the bundle: triggers "One must die"
- The bundle actually contains a rusted, serrated dagger stained red with ancient blood

> [!example]- One must die!  
> The first thing you hear is the Portcullis/Secret Door slamming shut, followed only moments later by rising chanting as thirteen dark apparitions appear on the ledges overlooking the room. Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch's fire is black and seems to draw light into it. Where you'd expect to see faces are voids. "One must die!" they chant, over and over. "One must die! One must die!"

- Above average WIS or INT: Understand that they must make a sacrifice
- Not fooled by illusions
- Don't care what type of creature
- Someone starts to leave the dais: the dirty water that fills the chamber seems to ripple and pulse beneath the surface.

Cool! It's rigged. Either everyone decides to leave or the sacrifice is made.

> [!example]- Enter: flesh mound  
> The cult spirits surrounding the room begin to (scream in fury/cry out in celebration) "Come demon! We awaken thee!"  
> The room begins to shake with each pulse of what feels like a beating heart. A gathering of bones, flesh, and body parts come together and rise out of the water as a giant, moving heap of gore.

bam it's fight time!  
…  
okay now fight is over.

> [!example]- walter is at peace!  
> As the horrifying pile of limbs and gore dissolves before your eyes, the only piece that remains is a small, white bundle, left on the altar. The shadows have vanished, and the deafening room returns to silence.  
> The "FEED HIM" that once was etched into the stone altar surface, now says "FREE HIM."  
> *choose to look in bundle:* This time, the bundle holds only the skeleton of a human baby.  
> *Party needs to find ~a way~ to put Walter to rest: put him in the crypt, leave him with Klara or Rose and Thorn, take him out of the house*  
> As you all come to agree to put Walter to rest at last, you can feel the heavy tension of the house begin to release. Emerging from the dungeon below, it takes a few seconds to recognized that you are even in the same house. The once well-lit and clean first floor looks no different from the rest of the house, covered in centuries of dust and age. The front door slowly creaks open.

# A3. Outside Death House

When the players exit Death House, the storm overhead has slowed to a mere drizzle, and the mists around the house have disappeared. Night has long since fallen, and the waning moon is high in the sky.

Most surprisingly, the players now find themselves in a dark forest clearing at the beginning of the <span class="citation">Old Svalich Road (p. 33)</span>, rather than in the streets of Daggerford. The road travels west. To the east lie dark, endless woods filled with the <span class="citation">Mists of Ravenloft (p. 23)</span>.

The house then collapses into the earth, leaving a dark and bottomless pit behind. If the players still have it, Elisabeth Durst's amber shard then crumbles into dust. The pit vanishes the first time the players depart the clearing.

If they're still possessing the players, [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Rosavalda "Rose" Durst|Rose]] and [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Thornboldt "Thorn" Durst|Thorn]]'s spirits end their possessions. The children remark that the woods look like their home—Barovia.

As the players explore their surroundings, they can quickly see the top of an old, ruined stone tower poking up through the treetops. The architecture of the tower is as described in <span class="citation">Will-o'-Wisp (p. 33)</span>, but the interior is not desecrated ground, there is no wooden chest on the ground, and there are no **zombies** or **will-o'-wisps** inside or around the tower.

The players can easily surmise that this ruin appears to be a safe place to spend the night. Rose and Thorn offer to serve as sentries while the players rest, watching the woods and awakening the players should any threats emerge.

The night passes without issue. When the players awaken the following morning, Rose and Thorn ask the players if they can bury their remains before proceeding any further, so that they can finally rest. (The children's spirits will not proceed further into Barovia, instead pleading for the players to allow them to rest.) If the players bury their remains here, the children's spirits thank them before vanishing.

The players can find the beginning of the Old Svalich Road a short ways through the woods away from the tower. [[dnd/Curse-of-Strahd-Reloaded/Act I - Into the Mists/Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]] then begins.

**_Milestone_**. Escaping Death House completes a story milestone. When the party begins their first long rest after escaping the house, award each player 400 XP. (This should allow the players to advance to 3rd level.)
