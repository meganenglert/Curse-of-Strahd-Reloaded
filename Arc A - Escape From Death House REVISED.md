The players begin in the town of Daggerford on the night before Highharvesttide, an annual feast and holiday celebration. The local inns are full for the night, and the players—vagabonds with little coin or company to speak of—find shelter in the stable of the Nightmare's Bridle, a ramshackle tavern on the outskirts of town. 

When the relics they carry sense the presence of Death House, however, the players are led through Daggerfords' rainy streets and into the house's waiting threshold.

Once inside, the players are trapped and told that a monster will hunt them down once it awakens. They have six hours to find it first and either appease it with a suitable sacrifice—or kill it. As they explore the house, they come to learn the house's lurid history, as well as the true identity of the beast that lurks beneath.

If the players kill the monster, the house begins to collapse, forcing them to flee or be lost in the rubble. Upon emerging, they find that their surroundings have changed, transporting them to the darkened land of Barovia.

If one or more of your players are using the [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Chapter 3 - Running the Game/Running the Adventure#Adventure Hooks|Barovian Relics]] hook, read the following text. Otherwise, proceed to [[#A2. Death House]] below.

<div class="description">
<p>It’s the evening before Highharvesttide, and a storm has descended over Daggerford, with dark clouds pouring cascades of rain down upon the town below. Despite the weather, however, the town buzzes with anticipation of the impending falltime festival, each home filled with warmth and joy. Bright, cheery candlelight twinkles from every window, and the sounds of song and dance echo throughout the wet and muddy streets.</p>
<p>Amidst the merriment, however, you stand apart. Neither locals nor visitors, you’re vagabonds—travelers, ghosts passing through an unfamiliar town. As laughter rings out from inns and homes, you face a simpler, starker dilemma: the quest for shelter.</p>
<p>Every room in this town is claimed, every hearth filled to bursting, leaving you in the grip of the bitter storm. Until, that is, the owner of the ramshackle Nightmare’s Bridle tavern offers you a grudging reprieve: the hayloft above their stable. It’s nothing to boast about, leaving the biting cold and the lingering scent of musty hay as your only companions. But it’s a roof over your heads nonetheless—a small mercy on a night such as this.</p>
<p>One by one, you find a home amidst the muck and hay. Overhead, rain lashes the stable, thunder punctuating the rhythmic drumming on the roof. Flashes of lightning lance across the skies, casting the stable’s interior in stark lights and darks. Rainwater drips steadily down through a leak in the roof, snaking its way across the floor until it pools in the corner.</p>
<p>Here, then, you find yourselves: huddled in the darkness amongst strangers, while joy and mirth dance just out of reach.</p>
</div>

Invite the players to describe each character's appearance and countenance, how they've positioned themselves, and how they've arranged their belongings.

When the players have finished introducing themselves, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A searing bolt of lightning rends the sky, illuminating the evening in a blinding flash of stark white. The booming thunder that follows is so loud it shakes the very ground beneath you, causing the timbers of the stable to creak and groan.</p>
<p>The light of the strike lingers unnaturally, silhouetting small wisps of fog that twist through the air. A thick, ankle-deep mist gathers outside, shrouding the earth in a ghostly veil. Its tendrils curl invitingly, as though beckoning you to the darkness beyond.</p>
<p>The rain continues to pelt the roof above, but the wind no longer howls, and the merry sounds of Daggerford’s festivities seem muted and distant. The horses in the stable beneath stir uneasily, their whinnies echoing loudly in the stillness. An uneasy feeling sweeps through the hayloft, a cold shiver that has nothing to do with the wind or rain.</p>
</div>

One by one, the players' relics then react as follows, in the following order.

* ***<mark style="background: #DBB9D5A6;">Stone Crest - Harmony.</mark>*** The crest emits a low hum and smells of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger when the crest is moved toward Death House.
* ***Broken Blade - Justice.*** The blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of Death House.
* ***Dragon's Scale - Inheritance.*** The scale burns icy cold, one end glowing with a bright, silver light in the direction of Death House.
* ***Sunrise Medallion - Faith.*** The medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, emitting rays of bright light in the direction of Death House.
* ***Amber Shard - Knowledge.*** The shard glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
* ***Wolf's Tooth - Healing.*** The tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
* ***Crumpled Page - Power.*** The ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that shows the page's location—and an arrow that guides toward Death House.
* ***Tattered Banner - Ambition.*** The sound of war-drums fills the air, and the banner blows in an unseen wind in the direction of Death House.
* ***Electrum Coin - Wealth.*** The coin lands on its edge and begins rolling across the muddy cobblestones in the direction of Death House.
* ***Angel's Feather - Redemption.*** The feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
* ***Raven's Feather - Duty.*** The feather is swept away by the wind, its shadow seeming to dance in the air, as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
* ***Wanderer's Scarf - Family.*** The scarf is carried away by the wind, its patterns shifting and turning in the air as it whirls through the streets toward Death House.

If the players give chase, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You emerge from the hayloft into the swirling mists beyond, the stones of Daggerford's streets slick and gleaming beneath your feet. The city’s laughter and cheer is now but a hollow echo, the brightness of its revelry drowned in the fog that encircles you. The taste of the cold, damp air is sharp on your tongue, and the sound of your own breath loud in your ears.</p>
<p>Your relics call you forward, the mists parting to make way. You move slowly at first, then faster, your hearts pounding in your chest. As you venture deeper into the fog, each step you make feels heavier, each echo of thunder a beat in this relentless march.</p>
<p>The fog swallows the town, buildings reduced to looming shadows, their shapes dancing and flickering in the storm's sporadic flashes of lightning. Rain drums a relentless rhythm, the patter of drops on cobblestone accompanying the distant, mournful peal of thunder. For brief moments, you can feel something else beneath your feet: the steady pounding of a deep and distant heartbeat.</p>
<p>You're pulled left, then right, then left again, the relics guiding you through the murky labyrinth. Distance and direction have lost all meaning, the shadows around you contorting in twisted shapes. Your blood sings in your ears, and the air grows denser, electric, as the energy of the storm—of the chase—swells with reckless abandon.</p>
<p>And then—the pounding stops.</p>
<p>The thunder pauses.</p>
<p>And the mist breaks.</p>
<p>The fog pulls back like a curtain, revealing a tall, eerie silhouette that towers in the gloom before you.</p>
</div>
This is **Death House.**

## A2a. The Arrival
### Area 1: Entrance
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 1.</em></span>

Read all players the following text:
<div class=description>
<p>A grand manor stands before you, four stories of cold, soot-stained stone, tall narrow windows, and high peaked roofs forming a picture of austere, chilling grandeur. Midway up, a narrow balcony juts out from the third floor, offering a grim perch from which to survey the surrounding grounds.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of this imposing facade is the portico, a stone arch standing sentinel before the house's oaken doors. A wrought-iron gate fills this arch, its rusty hinges creaking as it sways open in the wind.</p>
<p>On either side of the gate, oil lamps hang from chains, their light dim and flickering, casting a sickly glow that barely pierces the surrounding fog.</p>
<p>Beyond the gate, a set of sturdy oaken doors stand closed, framed by the gate and the lamps. The doors are old and weathered, their wood darkened by time, but they stand strong and proud—an unwelcome entrance to the house beyond.</p>
<p>A gust of wind sweeps past you, carrying with it a whisper of cold dread that sends shivers down your spine.</p>
</div>
(If any of the players' relics flew or rolled to Death House—as with the ***wanderer's scarf*** or the ***electrum coin***—they land on the house's threshold, just beyond the portico.) The street is otherwise deserted.

The entrance beyond the portico is otherwise as described:

> **1. Entrance (p. 212)**  
> ~~A wrought-iron gate with hinges on one side and a lock on the other fills the archway of a stone portico (area 1A). The gate is unlocked, and its rusty hinges shriek when the gate is opened. ~~Oil lamps hang from the portico ceiling by chains, flanking a set of oaken doors that open into a grand foyer (area lB). Hanging on the south wall of the foyer is a shield emblazoned with a coat-of arms (a stylized golden windmill on a red field), flanked by framed portraits of stony-fced aristocrats (Long-dead members of the Durst family). Mahogany-framed double doors leading from the foyer to the main hall (area 2A) are set with panes of stained glass.

> [!lore]+ **Strahd & the Cult**
> 
> The cult of Death House earned no love from Strahd in life. But in death, the two parties have come to an informal, unspoken understanding. 
> 
> In exchange for the permission to roam far afield from the misty land of Barovia to claim sacrifices, Death House is bound to return to the valley after each hunting excursion. Should any adventurers successfully escape the house's bloodied altar, they inevitably emerge into Strahd's domain—assuring him of a worthy crop of prey to pursue. 

### Area 2A: Main Hall
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 2 (p 212).</em></span>

> A wide hall (area 2A) runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the freplace is a longsword (nonmagical) with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt. The wood-paneled walls are ornately sculpted with images of vines, fowers, nymphs, and satyrs. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, see serpents and skulls inconspicuously woven into the wall designs. The decorative paneling follows the staircase as it circles upward to the second foor. A cloakroom (area 2B) has several black cloaks hanging from hooks on the walls. A top hat sits on a high shelf.

When the players pass through Death House's threshold, any Barovian relics they carry cease to be active. (For example, the *sunrise medallion* ceases to glow.)

The main hall is largely as described in <span class="citation">Main Hall (p. 212)</span> but now contains a grandfather clock, which is placed in the circular space at the base of the stairs.

Instead of a longsword, the portrait of the Durst family from <span class="citation">6. Upper Hall (p. 213)</span> now hangs above the fireplace. In the portrait, Rose is holding a smiling doll wearing a yellow lace dress. A plaque beneath the portrait reads: *Mr. Gustav and Mrs. Elisabeth Durst, with their two children, Rosavalda and Thornboldt.*<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8sfpkn/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_part_2_entering/">1</a></sup>

Shortly after all of the characters enter the main hall, the front door slams shut, extinguishing all lights in the house. The sound of the rain outside completely vanishes, leaving the house eerily silent. 

> [!fail]- **Time in Death House**
> 
> When the clock strikes six, place three six-sided dice on the table in front of the players, with each side showing a six. Each pip on the dice represents twenty minutes until midnight.
> 
> As the players explore the house, tick this dice clock downward to indicate the passage of time, always starting with the die showing the lowest number. If the lowest die shows a one, you can tick it down to "zero" by removing it from the group instead.
> 
> The dice clock counts down as follows:
> - Each time the players enter a new floor of the house or dungeon, tick the dice clock down by one.
> - Each time the players make a Perception or Investigation check to search an entire room, tick the dice clock down by one.
> - Each time the players complete a short rest, tick the dice clock down by three.
> 
> The grandfather clock in the **Main Hall** sounds on the hour, every hour, and can be heard throughout the house and dungeon.
> 
> When the clock strikes midnight, the **flesh mound** in the **Ritual Chamber** awakens and makes a beeline for the players, exiting through the **Hidden Trapdoor** into the **Den of Wolves** if necessary to reach them. At least one minute should pass between the time the mound wakes up and the time that it first reaches the players, nullifying its *heavy sleeper* feature and allowing it to use its *multiattack* actions.

> [!fail]- **Resting in Death House**
> 
> Due to their midnight deadline, it is impossible for the players to take a long rest in Death House. However, the players might still need to take a short rest. Each time they do so in the main house, they experience one or more of the following hauntings:
> 
> - A player hears rats scrabbling up and down the spaces between the walls. A thick, choking stench of rot seeps into the room.
> - A player hears the sound of a woman's humming emanating from the opposite side of a closed door. If the door is cracked open, a cold blue eye stares back before vanishing.
> - A player hears footsteps descending from the attic, which stop outside of their door before moving away to the library. Soon after, a grinding noise can be heard coming from the library—the sound of the secret door.
> - A player hears maniacal laughter echoing from far below the house.
> - A player hears a pleading female voice in their right ear that swears that "it isn't his." Another, colder female voice in the player's left ear scoffs and says, "You would say that, you little *harlot*."

A player who opens any outside-facing door or curtain in Death House, or who exits onto any balcony, finds that the exterior of the house has been surrounded by thick, fleshy tendrils. Although the tendrils can be damaged, more grow back swiftly to replace them, sealing the players inside. A player who inspects the tendrils finds that they appear to be extruding from beneath the house.

## A2b. The First Floor
### Area 2B: Cloakroom
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 2.</em></span>

A player who investigates the cloakroom adjoining the Main Hall can observe an envelope poking from the pocket of one of the cloaks. The envelope, which is addressed to Lady Lovina Wachter, contains an invitation. It reads:

<div class="description" style="text-align:center; padding: 15px;">
You are cordially invited to join 
<div style="height: 3px;"></div>
<strong>MR. GUSTAV & ELISABETH DURST</strong>

<em>Dinner and refreshments to be served.</em>
</div>

### Area 3: Den of Wolves
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 3.</em></span>

This room is largely as described in <span class="citation">Den of Wolves (p. 212)</span>. 

> This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter's den. Mounted above the freplace is a stag's head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are three stufed wolves.  
> Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face the hearth, with an oak table between them supporting a cask of wine, two carved wooden goblets, a pipe rack, and a candelabrum. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs.  
> Two cabinets stand against the walls. The east cabinet sports a lock that can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. It holds a heavy crossbow, a light crossbow, a hand crossbow, and 20 bolts for each weapon. The north cabinet is unlocked and holds a small box containing a deck of playing cards and an assortment of wine glasses.  
> A trapdoor is hidden in the southwest corner of the Aoor. It can't be detected or opened until the characters approach it from the underside (see area 32). Until then, Death House supernaturally hides the trapdoor.

As the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>As you crack the door to this room open, you catch a glimpse of something feral beyond: an amber eye that flashes in the darkness, and a bestial muzzle curled into a snarl.</p>
</div>

If the players proceed, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The door cracks open, revealing a gray-furred wolf frozen into place. It's only a moment before you realize that it's not moving—and another before you realize that it's not alone.</p>
<p>This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter's den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag's head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are two more taxidermied wolves—a large gray wolf and a smaller brown wolf.</p>
<p>Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face a hearth, with an oak table between them supporting an assortment of objects. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs, and two cabinets stand against the walls. A pair of small toys seems to have been forgotten beneath one of the chairs.</p>
</div>

The discarded toys are small, plush gray wolves, whose threadbare coats show evidence of heavy mending and patchwork. Clumsy stitching on their stomachs read ROSE and THORN, respectively.

In addition to its other contents, the east cabinet contains three silvered crossbow bolts mixed in with the other twenty bolts. Meanwhile, the north cabinet also contains a mounted piece of child's needlework that depicts a boy and girl holding the hands of a young woman, alongside clumsily stitched words that read FOR MISS KLARA. The young woman's face has been slashed and cut out.

The first time that no players are looking at them, the three taxidermied wolves move. When the players next look at them, the large gray wolf is standing beside the smaller brown wolf, and the first gray wolf has turned its snarl toward the others.

A player that succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check can identify the large gray wolf as male and the other two as female.

### Area 5: Dining Room
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 5.</em></span>

Players that approach this door can hear the muffled sound of a lively dinner feast, including clinking glasses, quiet laughter, and distant conversation. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the room falls silent, leaving only the stillness and the cold grandeur of the room beyond.

This room is largely as described in <span class="citation">Dining Room (p. 213)</span>. 

> The centerpiece of this wood-paneled dining room is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight highbacked chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble freplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.  
> The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking amid the carved foliage.  
> Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry depicting hunting dogs and horse-mounted aristocrats chasing after a wolf hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.  
> The silverware tarnishes, the crystal cracks, the portrait fades, and the tapestry rots if removed from the house.

When the players enter it, read:

<div class="description">

<p>The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.</p>
<p>The table groans beneath the weight of a delicious-looking feast, still steaming hot. Exquisite dishes lay on grand platters: succulent roasted poultry glazed with a shimmering honey sauce, perfectly grilled cuts of beef still steaming lightly, a variety of cheeses and fresh fruits, and freshly baked breads giving off a comforting aroma. </p>
</div>

A player who partakes in the food suffers no ill effects.

### Area 4: Kitchen and Pantry
*This scene corresponds to Appendix B: Area 4

> The kitchen (area 4 A) is tidy, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, domeshaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door leading to a wellstocked pantry (area 4B). All the food in the pantry appears fresh but tastes bland.

> Behind a small door in the southwest corner of the kitchen is a dumbwaiter-a 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple ropeand-pulley mechanism that must be operated manually. The shaft connects to areas 7A (the servants' quarters) and 12A (the master bedroom). Hanging on the wall next to the dumbwaiter is a tiny brass bell attached by wires to buttons in those other areas. A Small character can squeeze into the elevator box with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The dumbwaiter's rope-and-pulley mechanism can support 200 pounds of weight before breaking.

When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You enter a tidy kitchen, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door.</p>
<p>In the front right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door set into the wall.</p>
</div>

If the players inspect the cookware, they find that the largest kitchen knife is missing.

A player who enters the pantry finds that one of the shelves contains a set of beautiful decorative plates painted with pictures of windmills. One of the plates appears to have been knocked off of the shelf and lies in shattered pieces on the floor, leaving an empty spot in the row of plates.

A few inches behind the empty spot on the shelf sits an antique copper pot, its lid slightly ajar. Peeking out from beneath the lid is the cork of what appears to be a bottle of wine.

A player who opens the pot finds it to contain a bottle of wine, a folded piece of delicate lace, a vial of a brownish dried powder, and a bouquet of wilted sunflowers tied to a small scroll of parchment.

* The wine's label shows that it is from the Wizard of Wines winery and provides the name of the wine: Champagne du le Stomp. (A player that drinks the wine finds it to have turned to vinegar, as though it has magically aged centuries in mere moments.)
* The piece of lace bears the initial "K" sewn onto one corner. 
* A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the brown powder as dried silphium, a contraceptive herb. 
* The parchment scroll reads: "For the light of my life. —G."

If the players read the note, one of the knives in the kitchen flies off of its shelf and embeds itself in the opposite wall.

## A2c. The Second Floor
### Area 6: Upper Hall
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 6.</em></span>

> [!quote] **6. Upper Hall** (213)
> 
> > [!info] Read aloud:  
> > Unlit oil lamps are mounted on the walls of this elegant hall. Hanging above the mantelpiece is a wood-framed portrait of the Durst family: Gustav and Elisabeth Durst with their two smiling children, Rose and Thorn. ==The caption reads: *Mr. Gustav and Mrs. Elizabeth Durst with their two children, Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst, 357.*==  
> > Standing suits of armor flank wooden doors in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. The doors are carved with dancing youths, although close inspection and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the youths aren't really dancing but fghting off swarms of bats. The red marble staircase that started on the first floor continues its upward spiral to [[#Balcony]]. A cold draft can be felt coming down the steps.

### Area 7: Servants' Room

> [!quote] **7. Servants' Room** (213)  
> An undecorated bedroom (area 7A) contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is an empty footlocker. Tidy servants' uniforms hang from hooks in the adjoining closet (area 7B).  
> *DUMBWAITER*  
> A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in area 4A.

When the players enter this room, read:
<div class="description">
<p>This undecorated bedroom contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is a closed foot locker. A door to the left appears to lead to a closet.</p>
<p>In the right-hand corner stands a small wooden door, a metal button set into the wall beside it. A basket full of unwashed laundry appears to have been left beside it.</p>
</div>

*If searched,* the basket contains a man's laundry, including fine suits, tunics, neckties, pants, and stockings. However, a single, much-smaller woman's slip appears to have been mixed in with the rest.

### Area 10: Conservatory
Players that approach this door can hear the faint sound of a harpsichord playing from beyond the doors. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the music falls silent.

> [!quote] **10. Conservatory** (214)  
> Gossamer drapes cover the windows of this elegantly appointed hall, which has a brass-plated chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Upholstered chairs line the walls, and stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments.  
> A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. Alabaster figurines of well-dressed dancers adorn the mantelpiece. Close inspection of them reveals that several are carvings of well-dressed skeletons.

When the players enter it, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You enter into an elegantly appointed hall, the windows of which are covered by gossamer drapes. A brass-plated chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and upholstered chairs line the walls. </p>
<p>Several stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments. A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. As you look away to survey the rest of your surroundings, you see a flash of movement, but all is still when your gaze returns to the instruments. </p>
</div>

***The Harpsichord.*** A player who inspects the harpsichord finds that one of the keys appears to be permanently pressed in the "down" position. A player who investigates the interior of the harpsichord finds the cause: a rolled-up piece parchment tucked beneath one of the strings. 

The parchment is a piece of handwritten sheet music for the harpsichord titled *Waltz for Klara*. If the sheet music is played on the harpsichord, read:  
<div class="description">
<p>As you press your fingers to the keys, the notes echo, a haunting melody filling the quiet, dusty room. As you continue to play, the music seems to take on a life of its own, your hands moving across the keys unbidden as if guided by an unseen force.</p>
<p>From the edges of the room, spectral figures begin to materialize, spinning and weaving in a ghostly dance as though led by the song. Most are unfamiliar to you, but you recognize two: Elisabeth Durst, in the corner, watching Gustav's apparition dancing with a beautiful young woman wearing humble clothes.</p>
<p>The eyes of Elisabeth's apparition narrow into a cold, furious stare. The dancers pay her little heed, however, the song growing faster as the spirits whirl to the rhythm of the harpsichord's crescendo.</p>
<p>With a swift movement, Elisabeth reaches for a pendant around her spectral neck—a shimmering amber shard hung on a cord of ethereal mist. As her ghostly fist curls around it, her eyes flash a bright, menacing amber—and the spectral dancers dissipate, swept away as if by an unseen wind.</p>
<p>Elisabeth's apparition lingers but a moment longer before disappearing with the rest. As it does, a sound resonates through the room: the low sound of scraping wood, originating from the room across the hall. The floor trembles faintly—and you hear a crash from the mantelpiece. Two of the alabaster figurines have fallen from their place on the shelf: one, toppled over on its side; the other, shattered across the floor.</p>
</div>

Playing *Waltz for Klara* also causes the bookshelf in the [[#Library]] to swing open, exposing the locked secret door beyond. (The scraping sound is the sound of the bookshelf scraping against the floor.)

### Library

The desk drawer is empty except for an iron key, which unlocks the door to area 20. The bookshelves hold hundreds of tomes covering a range of topics including history, warfare, and alchemy. There are also several shelves containing first-edition collected works of poetry and fiction. The books rot and fall apart if taken from the house.

When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this room. An exquisite mahogany desk and a matching high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Situated in corners of the room are two overstuffed chairs. </p>
<p>Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall. A rolling wooden ladder allows one to more easily reach the high shelves.</p>
</div>

***The Desk.*** A handwritten note sits atop the desk. It reads:

<div class="description">
<p>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Durst,</p>
<p>In light of my current condition, I respectfully ask your leave for a brief time away from my responsibilities. </p>
<p>While my devotion to your dear children makes this decision difficult, I have taken it upon myself to find a solution that, I hope, will serve your household well. A good acquaintance of mine is experienced in the care of children, and I believe that she could assume my role during my temporary leave without difficulty.</p>
<p>I realize that my request is not without its complications. However, my years serving your family have shown me the depth of your understanding and compassion. I truly feel that I have become a part of this family, and I look forward to bringing another member of that family into this world.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Klara</p>
</div>

The top drawer of the desk now contains a number of receipts for candles, daggers, and incense, rather than the key to [[#Children's Room]].

***The Bookshelves.*** A small rock collection sits upon one of the shelves, each of the stones labeled with its scientific name.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/49bvms/notes_from_running_death_house/">4</a></sup> (This collection once belonged to Mr. Durst.) 

Immediately beside the rock collection is a book titled _The Tale of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_, with the final word being the name of the player character who first found it. It appears blank to any other creature, but, if read by that player character, tells the story of their life.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/7pjhpa/dm_tips_curse_of_strahd_part_1_intro_death_house/">2</a></sup>

The final written page of this book reads:

<div class="description">
<p><em>&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; pulled the book down from the shelf and began to read, unaware of the creature that watched them from the shadows. Slowly, the beast began to creep forward.</em></p>
</blockquote>

The next page is blank, save for a bloodstain. A search of the room provides no evidence of any lurking monster.

A character that searches the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can see flickering candle light emanating from beneath the secret door.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/49bvms/notes_from_running_death_house/">4</a></sup>

> 
> As the players explore Death House and the many secret places within the land of Barovia, don't forget the **Multiple Ability Checks** rule (<span class="citation">Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 237</span>)

***The Secret Door.*** The secret door in this room has two components. First, a player must pull on the switch as described in <span class="citation">Secret Door (p. 214)</span>. 

> [!quote] SECRET DOOR  
> A secret door behind one bookshelf can be unlocked and swung open by pulling on a switch disguised to look like a red-covered book with a blank spine. A character inspecting the bookshelf spots the fke book with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Unless the secret door is propped open, springs in the hinges cause it to close on its own. Beyond the secret door lies area 9.

Doing so causes the bookshelf to swing forward, revealing a blank wooden wall behind it. 

Once the bookshelf has been moved, the players can see a small panel made of dark wood behind it, built into the wall at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche, jagged and irregular, lies at the panel's center and emanates a faint amber glow. 

The door cannot be opened unless the amber shard from the [[#Master Suite]] is placed into the niche. The secret door then swings open, allowing the players to enter the [[#Secret Room]].

### Secret Room
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 9.</em></span>

This room is largely as described in <span class="citation">Secret Room (p. 214)</span>. 

> [!quote] SECRET ROOM (214)  
> This secret room contains bookshelves packed with tomes describing fend-summoning rituals and the necromantic rituals of a cult called the Priests of Osybus. The rituals are bogus, which any character can ascertain after studying the books for 1 hour and succeeding on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest is a skeleton in leather armor. Close inspection reveals that the skeleton belongs to a human who triggered a poisoned dart trap. Three darts are stuck in the dead adventurer's armor and ribcage. The dart-fring mechanism inside the chest no longer functions. Clutched in the skeleton's left hand is a letter bearing the seal of Strahd von Zarovich, which the adventurer tried to remove from the chest. Written in fowing script, the letter reads as follows:

> The chest contains three blank books with black leather > covers (worth 25 gp each), three spell scrolls (bless, protection from poison, and spiritual weapon), the deed to the house, the deed to a windmill, and a signed will. The windmill referred to in the second deed is situated in the mountains east of Vallakie(see chapter 6, "Old Bonegrinder"). The will is signed by Gustav and Elisabeth Durst and bequeathes the house, the windmill, and > > all other family property to Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst in the event of their parents' deaths. The books, scrolls, deeds, and will age markedly if taken from the house but remain intact.

When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>This small hidden room is packed with bookshelves groaning with old and ominous-looking leather-bound tomes. A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest, its ribs and head caught beneath the lid, is a skeleton in leather armor.</p>
</div>

The chest no longer contains the deed to Old Bonegrinder. Additionally, change Strahd's letter to read as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>My most pathetic servant,</p>
<p>I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the one who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but a worm writhing in my earth.</p>
<p>You say that you are cursed, your fortune spent. Your husband took solace in the bosom of another woman, sired a bastard son, and drove you to abandon love for madness. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.</p>
<p>Your dread lord and master,</p>
<p>Strahd von Zarovich</p>
</blockquote>

The players do not recognize the name "Strahd von Zarovich."

> [!design]- **Design Note: Removing the Deed**  
> Players who find the deed to Old Bonegrinder in the secret chest often come to the mistaken conclusion that looting the deed makes them the new owners of the mill. Such players are likely, as a result, to attempt to explore the windmill during [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley]], triggering a conflict with the night hag coven and—through no fault of their own—a likely TPK. As such, the deed has been removed to help avoid this outcome.

## A2d. The Third Floor
As the players ascend the spiral stairs to the third floor, remind them that they can see down the center of the staircase all the way to the bottom floor.

### Balcony
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 11.</em></span>

This room is largely as described in <span class="citation">Balcony (p. 214)</span>. 

> [!quote] **11. Balcony**  
> Characters who climb the red marble staircase to its full height come to a dusty balcony with a suit of black plate armor standing against one wall, draped in cobwebs. This suit of animated armor attacks as soon as it takes damage or a character approaches within 5 feet of it. It fghts until destroyed. Oil lamps are mounted on the oak-paneled walls, which are carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny critters. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, notice tiny corpses hanging from the trees and worms bursting up from the ground.  
> *SECRET DOOR*  
> A secret door in the west wall can be found with a suc cessful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It pushes open easily to reveal a cobweb-flled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.

When the players enter this room, read:
<div class="description">
<p>You climb the red marble staircase to its full height, arriving at a dusty balcony. The air here is dry and musty, but tinged with a strange, coppery scent. </p>
<p>A suit of black plate armor stands against one wall, draped in cobwebs and marked by age. Oil lamps are mounted on the faded oak-paneled walls, which are carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny beasts.</p>
</div>

When triggered, the **animated armor** will use one or both of its **_multiattack_** attacks to attempt to push a player over the railing using a ***shove*** attack, or attempt to grapple its nearest target before shoving them prone.

If the armor is thrown down to the first floor and the players do not reveal their presence atop the balcony, it is unable to observe them with its sixty feet of blindsight, and is too stupid to think to climb back up. 

A creature that is pushed over the edge of the balcony falls two stories, or twenty feet, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or land prone.

> [!combat]- **Balancing the Animated Armor**  
> This combat encounter is a **mild** encounter against a party of five 2nd-level players, and will consume approximately 15% of their total maximum hit points. For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows:

> * ***Four Players.*** Reduce the armor's HP to 21.
> * ***Six Players.*** Increase the armor's HP to 48.

### Area 12: Master Suite
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 12.</em></span>

When a player first approaches this door, read:

<div class="description">
<p>These grand doors loom tall, their dark wood frames enclosing a pair of dusty stained-glass windows. Each pane is etched with intricate designs that resemble windmills, their once-vibrant hues now faded and obscured beneath a thick veil of grime.</p>
<p>Through the dusty haze that prickles your eyes , you catch a glimpse of something through the windows: a silhouette, standing mere inches behind the glass, lit from behind by a dim, amber glow. It's still and unmoving, but the mere sight of it seizes your muscles in a vice-like grip, your limbs refusing to obey your conscious mind.</p>
<p>The air around you thickens, its temperature plummeting to a bone-chilling cold. Your breath fogs the glass panes, a delicate frost creeping across them as the house's distant creaks and whispers are swallowed by a heavy silence.</p>
<p>The shadow behind the door is nearly formless—insubstantial—but its presence invokes a primordial dread deep within your marrow. Your heart beats faster, sweat beading on your forehead, pulse racing through your veins. Slowly, the silhouette begins to turn its head toward yours.</p>
<p>And then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the shadow evaporates. The biting cold ebbs away, and the house's quiet sounds return once more.</p>

A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the foor in front of the freplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of Gustav and Elisabeth Durst hanging above it. A web-flled parlor in the southwest corner contains a table and two chairs. Resting on the dusty tablecloth is an empty porcelain bowl and a matching jug,  
> A door facing the foot of the bed has a full-length mirror mounted on it. The door opens to reveal an empty, dust-choked closet (area 12B). A door in the parlor leads to an outside balcony (area 12C).

> A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in area 4A.  
> TREASURE  
> The jewelry box on the vanity is made of silver with gold fligree (worth 75 gp). It contains three gold rings (worth 25 gp each) and a thin platinum necklace with a topaz pendant (worth 750 gp).

When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You enter a dusty, cobweb-filled master bedroom with burgundy drapes covering the windows. A four-poster bed with embroidered curtains and tattered gossamer veils stands against the center wall.</p>
<p>A door facing the foot of the bed has a faded full-length mirror mounted on it. In the right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door, its surface half-rotted by age. A tarnished metal button is set into the wall beside it.</p>
<p>A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of the man and woman from the first-floor portrait hanging above it.

<p>The room also contains a matching pair of wardrobes, a padded chair, and a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and a silver jewelry box. A soft amber glow emanates from beneath the jewelry box's lid.</p>
</div>

***The Bed.*** A player that approaches the bed can see that a large, bloodstained kitchen knife has been driven into one of the pillows.

***The Jewelry Box.*** The jewelry box is empty of valuables. Instead, it is filled with grain, with an *amber shard* resting in the center of the box. (This amber shard is the unique key to the secret door in the [[#Library]].) 

A roll of parchment is half-buried in the grain beside the shard. If unfurled, it reads as follows:  
#TODO what is this  
A player can present the shard and speak Walter's name as a bonus action while within 30 feet of the **flesh mound** in the [[#Ritual Chamber]] to force the mound to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be dazed until the start of the player's next turn. (A dazed creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can't take a bonus action or a reaction.)

***The Balcony.*** A player that exits the bedroom onto the balcony sees only a wall of fleshy tendrils encompassing the exterior of the house. The tendrils are as described in [[#Main Hall]].

</div>

~~When a player first approaches within 5 feet of the **broom of animated attack**, it attacks with surprise as soon as they avert their eyes or turn away, thwacking them once upside the head. It then immediately returns to its initial position—now cobweb-free. On its future turns, the broom uses its **_multiattack_** to continue to attack any player not looking at it who remains within 5 feet, foregoing opportunity attacks against players that move away.~~

### Area 15: Nursemaid's Suite
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 15.</em></span>

> [!quote] **15. Nursemaid's Suite** (215)

> The bedroom once belonged to the family's nursemaid. The master of the house and the nursemaid had an affair, which led to the birth of a stillborn baby named Walter. The cult slew the nursemaid shortly thereafter. ~~Unless the characters already defeated it in area 18,~~ the nursemaid's spirit haunts the bedroom as a specter. ~~The specter manifests and attacks when a character opens the door to the nursery.

Mounted on the wall next to the wardrobe is a full-length mirror with an ornate wooden frame carved to look like ivy and berries. Characters who search the wall for secret doors or otherwise inspect the mirror can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, notice eyeballs among the berries. The wall behind the mirror has a secret door in it (see "Secret Door" below).  
> The nursery contains a crib covered with a hanging black shroud. When characters part the shroud, they see a tightly wrapped, baby-sized bundle lying in the crib. Characters who unwrap the blanket fnd nothing inside it.

> [!profile]- Miss Klara, the Nursemaid
> - I played her as tragic and shy, pressing her beautiful, ghostly form into the corner of her room in order to hide from the party. Margaret is a very confused ghost. She knows that something bad happened to her, but she doesn't actually remember dying. In fact, she frequently jumps between knowing and not knowing she's dead, between past and present.
> - Margaret speaks fondly of Mr. Durst, saying that he's a very kind man, but doesn't mention their affair out of propriety. If the players ask her outright about Walter being her child or of her relationship with Mr. Durst, she tells them, "It's not my place to speak of such things. I'm very sorry…" She also smiles beautifully if asked about Rose, Thorne, or Walter, claiming them all to be wonderful children. It should be obvious that she loves them very much.
> - If the characters ask Margaret about Mrs. Durst, her smile fades. She doesn't say anything outright bad about her mistress, but players should be able to sense from her mannerisms and answers that Margaret is actually afraid of Mrs. Durst.

When the players enter it, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Dust and cobwebs shroud this elegantly appointed bedroom. A large bed stands against the far wall, its once-opulent coverings now faded and threadbare. </p>
<p>Beside the bed, a mildew-covered towel covers most of a dusty yellowed book on one of its two end tables. On the far side of the room, you can see a pair of two more stained-glass doors, their windows flecked with dirt and grime.</p>
<p>To the left stands an empty wardrobe, its doors slightly ajar. Mounted beside it stands a full-length mirror, its wooden frame carved to resemble ivy and berries.</p>
<p>To the right, an empty doorway leads into a darkened nursery. You can see the silhouette of a crib, its quiet form veiled by a hanging black shroud. A strange substance seems to cover the floor beneath it.</p>
<p>As you look around the room, you notice that the blankets atop the bed lift slightly away from the mattress, as though something is lying atop the mattress beneath. As you watch, you can see the coverings, almost imperceptibly, slowly rise and fall with low, rhythmic rustling.</p>
</div>

***The Bed.*** A player that removes the covers from the bed finds that there is nothing beneath them. Instead, the player only finds a bloodstained mattress and crude hand-and-foot restraints made from barbed wire nailed to the four posts of the bed frame.

***The Doors.*** A player that exits the bedroom through the stained-glass doors and onto the balcony sees only a wall of fleshy tendrils encompassing the exterior of the house. The tendrils are as described in [[#Main Hall]].

***The Book.*** The book is a cobwebbed copy of a raunchy romance novel titled *Blue-Blooded Lips*. It tells the story of a peasant woman's romance with a wealthy duke.

***The Nursery.*** If a player approaches the crib, Klara simply asks them to be quiet since the baby is sleeping. When the players approach the bundle in the crib, it unfurls revealing nothing but the cloth and Margaret is gone.

***The Mirror.*** A secret door behind the mirror can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It pushes open easily to reveal a cobweb-filled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.

## A2e. The Attic
### Area 16: Attic Hall
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 16.</em></span>

> [!quote] **16. Attic Hall** (215)  
This bare hall is choked with dust and cobwebs.  
LOCKED DOOR  
The door to area 20 is held shut with a padlock. Its key  
is kept in the library (area 8), but the lock can also be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

 When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>This bare hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. Several doors lead from this attic corridor, including a door held shut with a padlock.</p>
<p>A low creak cuts through the air as one of the unlocked doors slowly creaks open.</p>

The door leads to the [[#Spare Bedroom]].

### Spare Bedroom
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 17.</em></span>

> [!quote] **17. Spare Bedroom** (215)  
This dust-choked room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a small iron stove, a writing desk with a stool, an empty wardrobe, and a rocking chair. A smiling doll in a lacy yellow dress sits in the northern window box, cobwebs draping it like a wedding veil. 

When the players first enter it, read:

<div class="description">
<p>This cold, dust-choked room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a small iron stove, a writing desk with a stool, an empty wardrobe, and a rocking chair. A frowning doll in a lacy yellow dress sits in the northern window box beside a tarnished old music box, cobwebs draping it like a wedding veil.</p>
</div>

The players can recognize the doll as the same doll that Rose was holding in the family portrait in the Main Hall.

The music box contains a rusted, bloodstained skinning knife as well as the key to the padlock on Rose and Thorn's bedroom door.

The music box also contains two curled-up pieces of parchment. The first parchment shows a basic floor plan split into three rectangles labeled QUARTERS, SHRINE, and ALTAR. QUARTERS and SHRINE are connected at the top by a single line, and at the bottom by a double line, which connects both to ALTAR. The second parchment contains a list of unfamiliar names beneath the word RECRUITMENT.

As the players exit the room, the rocking chair begins to rock softly and the music box opens and begins to play. The sound of motherly humming floats through the air for two measures, but grows off-key and distorted before coming to a violent, screeching halt. The rocking chair then stops rocking.

### Children's Room

Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that's a perfect replica of the dreary edifce in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs. Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons wearing tattered but familiar clothing. The smaller of the two cradles a stufed doll that you also recognize.
> 
> The Durst children, Rose and Thorn, were neglected by their parents and locked in this room until they starved to death. Their small skeletons lie in the middle of the foor, plain as day, wearing tattered clothing that > he characters recognize as belonging to the children. Thorn's skeleton cradles the boy's stufed doll. The toy chest contains an assortment of stuffed animals and toys. Characters who search the dollhouse and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check find all of the house's secret doors, including one in the attic that leads to a spiral staircase (a miniature replica of area 21).

- Once the characters discover the children's remains, Rose and Thorne will reappear with memories far more intact. They'll also actually look like ghosts this time, spectral and see-through. At this point, they'll recall that they were often locked away when their parents went to "deal with the monster" and that the last time, no one came back for them. They were "so very hungry, but no one came when we cried. And then the hunger went away and we grew very cold and went to sleep."
- The final conversation with Rose and Thorne's ghosts in the attic should have the children implore the players for help yet again. They remember much more this time around, but they're still ignorant to the true nature of their parents. However, Rose thinks that their mother might have taken Walter to the basement last. She asks the players to save their baby brother and their parents and defeat the monster once and for all. If asked how to get into the basement, Rose points at the dollhouse revealing the secret entry.

If asked how one gets to the basement, Rose points to the doll house and says, "There's a secret door in the attic." Characters who then search the dollhouse for secret doors gain advantage on their Wisdom (Perception) checks to fnd them.  
> The children fear abandonment. If one or more characters try to leave, the ghost-children attempt to possess them. If one of the ghosts possesses a character, allow the player to retain control of the character, but assign the character one of the following faws:

> - A character possessed by Thorn gains the following faw: "I'm scared of everything, including my own shadow, and weep with despair when things don't go my way."

> A character possessed by the ghost of Rose or Thorn won't willingly leave Death House or the dungeon below it. Both ghosts can be intimidated into leaving their hosts with a successful DC 11 Charisma (Intimidation) check made as an action.

In life, Rose was a budding wizard who discovered a small spellbook in her father's library, and took great care in copying the _mending_, _light_, and _shocking grasp_ cantrips into her diary.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/49bvms/notes_from_running_death_house/">4</a></sup>

As the ghost children speak with the players, Thorn levitates one of his toys into the air, which falls and breaks. Rose swiftly uses her _mending_ spell to repair it. If her use of magic is remarked upon, she shyly shares her diary's location, which can be found hidden in the cobweb-covered pillowcase on her bed.

In addition to her cantrips, Rose's aged and faded diary also contains entries regarding her studies, her friends, her younger brother, her nursemaid ("Miss Klara"), and arguments between her mother and father. (Rose doesn't know anything about the content of those fights.)

Rose knows the way down to the basement, but "isn't supposed to go down there." If the party convinces her to show them the way, she points them toward the dollhouse, revealing the secret entry. In exchange, she asks the players to take her and Thorn's bones with them when they escape, burying them in the garden outside. 

The dollhouse contains small dolls that depict tiny, twisted molds of any characters and creatures currently visible in the house. The dolls are made of painted resin. Any character looking inside the dollhouse while in Rose and Thorn's room can see the appropriately-placed dolls of all living creatures within the manor. The dollhouse only contains rooms within the house itself, and does not depict the dungeon levels below.

When the secret door is revealed, Thorn shyly asks the players if he and Rose can accompany them downstairs to aid them, and attempts to possess a friendly player if permitted. When Rose or Thorn attempts to possess a player, describe it as "a child's tiny hand, desperately seeking the touch of another soul." 

A player possessed by Rose can cast the cantrips in her diary, while a player possessed by Thorn can gain the effects of the _mage hand_ cantrip as an action, without the use of components. (The spectral hand is invisible.)

### Area 18: Storage Room
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 18.</em></span>

> [!quote] **18. Storage Room** (215)  
> This dusty chamber is packed with old furniture (chairs, coat racks, standing mirrors, dress mannequins, and the like), all draped in dusty white sheets. Near an iron stove, underneath one of the sheets, is an unlocked wooden trunk containing the skeletal remains of the family's nursemaid, wrapped in a tattered bedsheet stained with dry blood. A character inspecting the remains and succeeding on a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check can verify that the woman was stabbed to death by multiple knife wounds. If the characters disturb the remains, the nursemaid's specter appears ~~and attacks~~ unless it was previously defeated in area 15.  
> SECRET DOOR  
> A secret door in the east wall appears only when certain conditions are met; see area 21 for more infrmation.

When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>This dusty chamber is packed with lumpy, squat shapes draped in dusty white sheets. An old iron stove stands against the right-side wall, next to what looks to be a large trunk covered by a sheet.</p>
</div>
If the players investigate the corpse, they see that the front of her dress has multiple stab wounds, indicating her murder. 

A player inspecting the remains feels a cold breath on their shoulder and the unshakeable sense of being watched. Meanwhile, if another player has previously uncovered a nearby mirror from its sheet covering, that player can see an apparition of Elisabeth Durst within the mirror staring at the player near the chest. Once observed, the apparition swiftly vanishes.

**_Milestone_**. Descending into Death House's dungeon level completes a story milestone. When the party gains access to the secret stairs, award each player 200 XP.

Tonight's ceremony will proceed as planned when the moon is at its highest peak - without, of course, the attendance of Mr. Durst.

### Area 21: Secret Stairs
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 21.</em></span>

> [!quote] **21. Secret Stairs** (217)  
> A narrow spiral staircase made of creaky wood is contained within a 5-foot-wide shaft of mortared stone that starts in the attic and descends 50 feet to the dungeon level, passing through the lower levels of the house as it makes its descent. Thick cobwebs fll the shaft and reduce visibility in the staircase to 5 feet.  
> The secret door and shaft don't exist until the house reveals them, which can happen in one of two ways: 
> - The characters find Strahd's letter in the secret room behind the library (area 9). 
> - The characters find the replica secret door in the attic of the doll house (area 20). 
> 
> Once the house wills the secret door into existence, characters find it automatically if they search the wall (no ability check required). Characters who descend the spiral staircase end up in area 22.

However, opening the secret door reveals only a stone slab on the opposite side, inset with a small bronze panel at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche identical to the one in the library lies at the panel's center, emanating a faint amber glow. When the niche is exposed, the amber shard from the [[#Master Suite]] glimmers faintly and swings in the air toward it, as though held aloft by an unseen force.

To allow the stone slab to swing open and reveal the hidden stairs on the opposite side, the players must place the amber shard into the niche.

When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The secret door opens to reveal a narrow spiral staircase built of aged-looking wood within a tight shaft of mortared stone. Thick cobwebs fill the staircase as it descends into the darkness below.</p>
</div>

As the players descend the stairs, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The broken cobwebs around you sway like a gossamer wedding veil, beckoning you forward as the ancient stairs creak and groan underfoot. The gaping maw of the stairwell draws you deeper, swallowing you up as you descend further down its gullet. You descend one floor—two floors—three.</p>
<p>The walls of the stone shaft narrow around you, forcing you to hunch your shoulders and pull in your elbows to continue downward. In the darkness, you can only hear the shuffle of your feet, the choking groan of the stairs, and the pounding of your blood in your ears. </p>
<p>Finally, after what feels like hours, the descent levels out, and the spiral staircase ends at a darkened landing of packed earth. A narrow tunnel supported by aged timber braces stretches ahead of you, its stone walls seeming to bleed with deposits of streaked, red clay. Eight feet ahead, the tunnel splits, branching to the left and right.</p>
<p>As your eyes and ears adjust to the cold, subterranean corridor, you notice that the tunnel isn't as silent as the staircase above. An eerie, low-pitched sound echoes through the space—and you soon recognize it as a deep, incessant chanting.</p>

### Area 34: Cult Leader's Quarters
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 34.</em></span>

- This is where the party will find the hanging corpse of Mr. Durst. Don't forget the suicide note in his pocket after the following confrontation is over.
- After a moment, Mrs. Durst in her ghast form will burst from one of the earthen walls. Unlike the other ghouls who outright attacked the party, Mrs. Durst can actually speak. She's retained her memory but has also completely succumbed to her dark whims. Her lips and gums have gone black with rot and she smiles madly at the characters. When she introduces herself, tell the players that after closer inspection they can see the vague resemblance to the portrait of her in the main house.
- Mrs. Durst has gone completely mad. She's arrogant and believes herself better than everyone, looking down on the players. She shuns her dead husband and calls him a lecherous traitor who deserved to die. She has even less kind words for Walter and the nursemaid. She even writes off her own children as bothersome nuisances. Don't be afraid to be vulgar when voicing Mrs. Durst. Try to give her a hissing, gargling voice and use some language you wouldn't use in front of your mother. It'll make the party hate her all the more.
- Should the players ask what she did to Walter, she grins and tells them, "Why don't you go down even further and find out for yourself."
- Mrs. Durst eventually tells the players to get out. But most likely, your players will feel inclined to end her. Good. She's meant to be utterly repulsive and killing her will make them all feel really great.
- If they defeat her, they turn around to see the corpse no longer there, with a folded piece of paper fluttering down from where it had hung.

***Mr. Gustav Durst's Suicide Note.*** Can be found on corpse's body after confrontation with ghast. 

> My Beloved Children,
> 
> I wish I could do what all fathers do and tell you that monsters aren't real. But it wouldn't be true.
> 
> Life can create things of exquisite beauty. But it can also twist them into hideous beings. Selfish. Violent. Grotesque. Monstrous. It hurts me to say that your mother has turned into one such monster, inside and out. And I'm afraid the disease that afflicted her mind has taken hold of me as well.
> 
> It sickens me to think what we've put you through. There is no excuse. I only ask of you, though I know I do not have the right to do so, to try and forgive us. I despise what your mother has become, but I love and pity her all the same.
> 
> Rose, I wish I could see you blossom into a strong, beautiful woman. Thorne, Walter, I wish I could be there for you. But I can't. This is the only way.
> 
> Goodbye.

> The southernmost tunnel slopes down at a 20-degree angle into murky water and ends at a rusty portcullis (area 37).

When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The dusty stone steps descend past a landing and around a bend until they end at a cold, rectangular chamber. A thin, wafting mist clings to the ground, and the wooden cross beams that support the ceiling groan beneath the weight of the house and underground complex above. </p>
<p>The walls of this room are cut with small, chiseled alcoves, each holding a strange, ghastly trinket or relic. A corridor with a sagging ceiling exits the chamber and bends out of sight to the right. Past it, you can see a stone slope that descends into black, murky water. The ghostly chant you've heard since entering the basement is strongest here, and seems to be emanating from the other side of a rusted, closed portcullis.</p>
<p>You can finally understand the words.</p>
<p>They say, over and over again, in a ceaseless refrain:</p>

 When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The sound of clinking chains melds with a quiet, near-imperceptible rustling as you round the bend into a long, darkened dungeon. Rusted shackles hang patiently from the walls, as if waiting to bite into prisoners' flesh once more.</p>

### Area 37: Portcullis
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 37.</em></span>

> [!quote] **37. Portcullis** (219)  
> This tunnel is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis that can be forcibly lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Otherwise, the portcullis can be raised or lowered by turning a wooden wheel half-embedded in the east wall of area 38. (The wheel is beyond the reach of someone east of the portcullis.) The foor around the portcullis is submerged under 2 feet of murky water.

 When the players approach this area, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The floor is submerged beneath two feet of dark, murky water that sloshes around your calves and boots. The tunnel forward is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis. Beyond its iron bars, you can make out the dark outline of a half-submerged chamber, a raised stone dais, and a thick cloud of rolling mist.</p>
</div>

The wooden wheel that opens the portcullis remains on the western side of the gate (i.e., the side facing the [[#Ritual Chamber]]). However, the chain-link mechanism to open the portcullis has broken, preventing the players from proceeding without repairing it (e.g., by using Rose's _mending_ cantrip) or lifting the portcullis by hand. (If the players lift the portcullis by hand and then release it, its weight causes it to shut once more unless propped open.)

### u/MandyMod's Final Encounter
**Rigging One Must Die.** If the players refuse to kill anybody during "One Must Die", Lancelot the dog included, the cult spirits are angered and summon Walter. If the players do sacrifice something or someone, the cult spirits chant victoriously and summon Walter.

**"Come, demon! We awaken thee!"** Also, go ahead and change the final summoning chant. Lorgoth the Destroyer is very wordy and eye-roll worthy. I changed the chant to, "Come, demon! We awaken thee!" Simple and to the point.

#### What Happened to Walter
- Through the Dark Power that came to the final sacrifice and changed the cultists into ghouls, Walter has been turned into a horrible monster. He's essentially a modified shambling mound that I call, The Flesh Mound.
- When summoned, the dirty water that fills the chamber seems to ripple as something moves beneath the surface. A gathering of bones, flesh, and body parts come together and rise out of the water as a giant, moving heap of gore.
- The Flesh Mound is far too powerful for a group of level 2 players to take down. In fact, they probably all sense that this thing is going to flat out kill them. Luckily, I put in a loophole. Throughout the battle, the Flesh Mound will try to grapple and swallow players, absorbing them in the gore. This can definitely do them damage, but at the same time give them the answer. At the center of the Flesh Mound is a small cavity containing the body of baby Walter, a crying corpse attached to the rest of the mound by sinuous ligaments. A swallowed player will have the chance to see this infant form. Severing the ligaments or killing the baby (this should feel more like putting Walter out of his misery), will cause the whole Flesh Mound to fall apart. When the mound dies, all that's left is the corpse of the baby, which the players can put to rest in his crypt if they please.

#### Trapping Players in the Altar Room
- Like I said, I really wanted this encounter to happen. It's a final boss after all and it puts a nice cap on the story, telling the players what happened to Walter as well as getting rid of "the monster". Missing it is like not reading the final chapter in a book.
- I made the chanting spirits responsible for keeping players in the room so that they couldn't miss this encounter. I gave the spirits the Shadow stat block and made it so that they only attack players who have left the altar room. I also gave them the ability to pass through solid objects like it was difficult terrain so that they could cut off fleeing characters by passing through walls.

#### Flesh Mound Statblock
![[Pasted image 20240107124035.png]]

#### Ending
And that's that! Once Walter is defeated, the curse is lifted from the house. The players can safely move throughout the house, though the first two floors are no longer preserved, appearing as dusty and old as the third floor and the attic. They can put the rest of the Durst family to rest if they like, and the character that does so may deserve some inspiration. Otherwise, your party should be effectively horrified and ready to move on to the Village of Barovia. Well done! Stay tuned for the next installment.

### Area 38: Ritual Chamber
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Appendix B: Area 38.</em></span>

> [!quote] **38. Ritual Chamber** (219-220)  
> The cult used to perform rituals in this sunken room. The chanting heard throughout the dungeon originates here, yet when the characters arrive, the dungeon falls silent as the chanting mysteriously stops.
> 
> > [!info]  
> > The chanting stops as you peer into this forty-foot-square room. The smooth masonry walls provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and a breach in the west wall leads to a dark cave heaped with refuse. Murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais that also rises above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood.
> 
> The water is 2 feet deep. The ledges and central dais are 5 feet high (3 feet higher than the water's surface), and the chamber's ceiling is 16 feet high (11 feet above the dais and ledges). The chains dangling from the ceiling are 8 feet long; the cultists would shackle prisoners to the chains, dangle them above the altar, cut them open with knives, and allow the altar to be bathed in blood.  
> Half embedded in the east wall is a wooden wheel connected to hidden chains and mechanisms. A character can use an action to turn the wheel, raising or lowering the nearby portcullis (see area 37).  
> The hole in the west wall leads to a naturally formed alcove. The half-submerged pile of refuse that flls it is a shambling mound, which the cultists dubbed Lorghoth the Decayer. It is asleep but awakens if attacked or if the characters summon the cultists but refuse to complete their ritual (see "One Must Die!" below). A character standing next to the mound can discern its true nature with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check.  
> ***"One Must Die!"***  
> If any character climbs to the top of the dais, read:
> 
> > [!info]  
> > The chanting rises once more as thirteen dark apparitions appear on the ledges overlooking the room. Each one resembles a black-robed fgure holding a torch, but the torch's fre is black and seems to draw light into it. Where you'd expect to see faces are voids. "One must die!" they chant, over and over. "One must die! One must die!"
> 
> The apparitions are harmless figments that can't be damaged, turned, or dispelled.  
> Characters on the dais when the cultists appear must sacrifice a creature on the altar or face the cult's wrath; characters can ascertain what must be done with a successful DC 11 Intelligence (Religion) or Wisdom (Insight) check. To count as a sacrifice, a creature must die on the altar. The apparitions don't care what kind of creature is sacrificed, and they aren't fooled by illusions.  
> If the characters make the sacrifice, the cultists fade away, but their tireless chant of "He is the Ancient. He is the Land," echoes again in the dungeon. Strahd is aware of the sacrifice, and Death House now does nothing to hinder the characters (see "Endings" below).  
> If the characters leave the dais without making the sacrifice, the cultists' chant changes: "Lorghoth the Decayer, we awaken thee!" This chant rouses the shambling mound and prompts it to attack. It pursues prey beyond the room but won't leave the dungeon. It can move through tunnels without squeezing and completely fills its space. At the start of the shambling mound's first turn, the chant changes again: "The end comes! Death, be praised!" If the shambling mound dies, the chanting stops and the apparitions vanish forever.

 When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The smooth masonry walls of this forty-foot-square room provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais that also rises above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood. A small, white bundle lies atop it, surrounded by pulsating, fleshy tendrils.</p>
<p>The tendrils run to a breach in the far wall that leads to a dark cave, their fleshy masses connecting to a dark, hulking shadow that lies within, its bloated mass rising and falling with a slow, shuddering rhythm.</p>
<p>As soon as you step foot into the chamber, the ghostly chanting you've heard suddenly falls silent.</p>
</div>

A player that approaches the altar sees that the words "FEED HIM" are carved into its flat stone surface just below the white bundle, surrounded by several fleshy tendrils inset with human teeth. The tendrils belong to the **flesh mound** (see below), which awakens and attacks if the tendrils are damaged.

The bundle atop the altar is the size and shape of an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes. If unwrapped, the players instead find it to hold a rusted, serrated dagger stained red with ancient blood.

The dark shadow in the cave is a **flesh mound** containing Walter's spirit and remains.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8sfpkn/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_part_2_entering/">1</a></sup> It is a swollen, bloated mound of bones, flesh, and gore that seems to breathe as its mass rises and falls. A player that observes it concludes that it appears to be sleeping.

The cultists' shadows described in <span class="citation">"One Must Die!" (p. 220)</span> do not appear when a player climbs the altar. Instead, the players have two choices: sacrifice a living creature on the altar, or attack the flesh mound.

If a creature is sacrificed on the altar, the flesh mound's tendrils accept its corpse and pull it to the mound's lair. There, the mound messily devours it before returning its tendrils to the altar once more. Feeding the mound does not free the players, because its hunger cannot be sated.

The flesh mound awakens if attacked. When it does, its subsequent screeching wail causes the earth to tremble, sending the [[#Portcullis]] crashing to the ground if it's been opened and damaging the mechanism responsible for opening it.

In combat, the flesh mound begins in its **first form**. For one minute after it has awoken, the flesh mound's **_heavy sleeper_** feature prevents it from using its ***multiattack*** actions in either form.

A creature engulfed by the mound's first form can hear the faint sound of a baby crying at the center of its swollen bulk.

> [!warning]+ **Elisabeth's Amber Shard**
> 
> Remember that a player in possession of Elisabeth's amber shard from the **Master Suite** can present the shard and speak the name "Walter" while within 30 feet of the **flesh mound**, forcing the mound to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be dazed until the start of the player's next turn. (A dazed creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can't take a bonus action or a reaction.)

> Death House harbors no ill will toward a party willing to sacrifce a life to appease the cult. Once the sacrifce is made, the characters are free to go. Upon emerging from the house, the characters advance to 3rd level.  
> *THE CuLT Is DENIED*  
> If the characters deny the cult its sacrifce and either destroy the shambling mound or escape from it, Death House attacks them as they try to leave. When they return upstairs, they must roll initiative as they discover several architectural changes: 
> - All the windows are bricked up; the bricked-up windows and the outer walls are impervious to the party's weapon attacks and damage-dealing spells. 
> - All the doors are gone, replaced by slashing scythe blades. A character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to pass through a blade-trapped doorway unscathed. A character who spends 1 minute studying the blades in a particular doorway can try to take advantage of a momentary gap in their repeating movements and make a DC 15 Intelligence check instead. Failing either check, a character takes 2dl0 slashing damage but manages to pass through the doorway. Any creature pushed through a doorway must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the damage. The blades can't be disarmed. 
> - Every room that contains a freplace, an oven, or a stove is flled with poisonous black smoke. The room is heavily obscured, and any creature that starts its turn in the smoke must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take ldlO poison damage. 
> - The interior walls become rotted and brittle. Each 5-foot-section has AC 5 and 5 hit points, and can also be destroyed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Each 5-foot section of wall that's destroyed causes a swarm of rats to pour out and attack. The swarm won't leave the house. 
> 
> Keep track of initiative as the characters make their way through the house. Once they escape, they advance to 3rd level, and the house does no more to harm them.

When the **flesh mound** dies, the players can hear the sound of the house's front door opening far overhead, and the distant thunderstorm beyond.

When the players next begin to move toward the exit, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A guttural moan ripples through the air—and a terrifying apparition manifests before you: the spirit of Elisabeth Durst, her once-beautiful features now grotesquely distorted. Her lustrous hair is a wild, disheveled mess, her skin a deathly pallor, and her lips peeling back to reveal sharp, yellowed teeth. An amber shard glows ominously on a cord around her spectral neck, a shadowed wisp swirling within its depths.</p>
<p>The spirit levitates high above the floor, sunken eyes blazing with malice and mouth twisted into a snarl. "You may have evaded my pet," it rasps, "but I will tear this house apart before I let you escape." It throws its head back and lets loose a blood-curdling scream that reverberates across the stone walls—and sets the very foundations of the house trembling.</p>
<p>Far above, the grandfather clock begins to chime, the sound mounting to a thunderous cacophony. Dust and debris rain down as the floor shakes beneath you, the wooden cross beams of the ceiling starting to splinter and crack. Elisabeth's spirit fixes you with a feral grin—and then dissipates into thin air, leaving only echoes of its spiteful laugher as the house rumbles, shifts, and groans.</p>
</div>

The players must flee from the ritual chamber to the [[#Entrance]] of Death House before the entire structure collapses upon their heads. However, they don't need to roll initiative, and the architectural changes described in <span class="citation">The Cult is Denied (p. 220)</span> are not present. 

Instead, as the players escape the crumbling Death House, they face two additional obstacles.

***Gustav's Ghost.*** As the players move to exit the [[#Reliquary]], the ghost of Gustav Durst (use the statistics of a **poltergeist**, but without its ***invisibility*** feature) confronts them. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>An ethereal apparition appears before you, obstructing the stairs—the ghost of a man. He is a gaunt and pale figure, with sunken, haunted eyes and trembling hands, wearing once-fine clothing now tattered with age.</p>
<p>"Please," the spirit says, tears beading at the corners of his eyes. "You have to stay here and die. She won't accept anything else."</p>
</div>

The spirit is recognizable as Gustav Durst. Gustav pleads with the players to give up, insisting that Elisabeth's spirit is simply too powerful—too fearsome—to disobey. A DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that Gustav is terrified of Elisabeth—and ridden with guilt, doubt, and self-loathing.

If the players attempt to bypass or attack Gustav, a swarm of levitating debris and shrapnel arises around him. He pleads with the players again, insisting that he doesn't want to fight them, but that he doesn't know that he has any other choice.

> [!combat]- **Balancing the Poltergeist**  
> This combat encounter is a **bruising** encounter against a party of five 2nd-level players, and will consume approximately 28% of their total maximum hit points. For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows:
> 
> * ***Three Players.*** Reduce Gustav's HP to 13. Reduce his ***forceful slam*** attack to 6 (3d4-1) force damage and his ***telekinetic thrust*** action's attack to 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.
> * ***Four Players.*** Reduce Gustav's HP to 18. Reduce his forceful slam attack to 8 (3d4+1) ***force damage*** and his ***telekinetic thrust*** action's attack to 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage.
> * ***Six Players.*** Increase Gustav's HP to 26. Increase his ***forceful slam*** attack to 12 (3d6+2) force damage and his ***telekinetic thrust*** action's attack to 6 (1d12) bludgeoning damage.

The players can convince Gustav to step aside with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check. Alternatively, if the players reference Gustav's history with Elisabeth and Klara, they can convince him to stand aside with a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, succeeding automatically if they show him empathy or kindness or if they ask Rose and Thorn's spirits to assist them in their plea.

If the players successfully persuade Gustav to stand aside, he warns them that "her other servants" are lying in wait ahead to block the players' escape. "Don't fear them," he says. "Their only power is fear." He then vanishes.

***The Cult's Return*** When the players first reach the [[#Family Crypts]] or (if they have previously found and opened the hidden trapdoor described in **32. Hidden Trapdoor**, p. 219) near the [[#Darklord's Shrine]], the spirits of the cult arise to stop them. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The chanting rises once more as thirteen dark apparitions appear around you, obstructing the way forward—as well as the way back. Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch's fire is black and seems to draw light into it. Where you'd expect to see faces are voids. "He is the Ancient!" they chant, over and over. "He is the Land!"</p>
</div>

The apparitions are harmless and intangible figments that can't be damaged, turned, or dispelled. At the end of each round, each player that remains between the apparitions must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage from falling debris.

# A3. Outside Death House
When the players exit Death House, the storm overhead has slowed to a mere drizzle, and the mists around the house have disappeared. Night has long since fallen, and the waning moon is high in the sky.

Most surprisingly, the players now find themselves in a dark forest clearing at the beginning of the <span class="citation">Old Svalich Road (p. 33)</span>, rather than in the streets of Daggerford. The road travels west. To the east lie dark, endless woods filled with the <span class="citation">Mists of Ravenloft (p. 23)</span>.

The house then collapses into the earth, leaving a dark and bottomless pit behind. If the players still have it, Elisabeth Durst's amber shard then crumbles into dust. The pit vanishes the first time the players depart the clearing.

If they're still possessing the players, [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Rosavalda "Rose" Durst|Rose]] and [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Appendices/Non-Player Characters#Thornboldt "Thorn" Durst|Thorn]]'s spirits end their possessions. The children remark that the woods look like their home—Barovia.

As the players explore their surroundings, they can quickly see the top of an old, ruined stone tower poking up through the treetops. The architecture of the tower is as described in <span class="citation">Will-o'-Wisp (p. 33)</span>, but the interior is not desecrated ground, there is no wooden chest on the ground, and there are no **zombies** or **will-o'-wisps** inside or around the tower.

The players can easily surmise that this ruin appears to be a safe place to spend the night. Rose and Thorn offer to serve as sentries while the players rest, watching the woods and awakening the players should any threats emerge.

The night passes without issue. When the players awaken the following morning, Rose and Thorn ask the players if they can bury their remains before proceeding any further, so that they can finally rest. (The children's spirits will not proceed further into Barovia, instead pleading for the players to allow them to rest.) If the players bury their remains here, the children's spirits thank them before vanishing.

The players can find the beginning of the Old Svalich Road a short ways through the woods away from the tower. [[dnd/strahd-reloaded/Act I - Into the Mists/Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]] then begins.

**_Milestone_**. Escaping Death House completes a story milestone. When the party begins their first long rest after escaping the house, award each player 400 XP. (This should allow the players to advance to 3rd level.)

# Design Notes: Death House
***The Arrival.*** The illusory Rose and Thorn have been intentionally removed from this version of Death House in order to ensure that the players enter the house of their own volition and trust the real Durst children upon meeting them.

The countdown and poem have been added to provide the players with a clear sense of direction and purpose while exploring the house, and to prevent the players from taking a long rest (and therefore disrupting the balance of subsequent combat encounters) while doing so.

***The First Floor.*** The feast in the dining room has been made intentionally harmless in order to encourage the players to trust the safety of Strahd's dinner invitation when they later receive it. Additional clues have been added to convey to the players the relationships within the Durst family, including Mr. Durst's affair.

***The Second Floor.*** Clues have been added to ease the discovery of the library's secret room and to convey the depth of Mr. Durst's affair, as well as the nursemaid's pregnancy.

The dog Lancelot, a popular community character, has been intentionally cut from Death House to avoid providing the players with an easy sacrifice to make at the altar in the ritual chamber—a sacrifice that is no longer functional (because the cult no longer releases the players upon making a sacrifice) and which rings hollow when compared to the campaign that procedes it (because Strahd's "hunger" cannot be sated.)

***The Third Floor.*** The nursemaid's specter now serves as a vital tool that allows the players to find the attic staircase without undue frustration or delay. Additional clues have been added to convey the fate of Walter, Mr. Durst, and the nursemaid.

***The Attic.*** Clues have been added to convey the nursemaid's fate and the founding of Mrs. Durst's cult.

***The Dungeon.*** Several of the encounters in this area have been changed to reduce the probability of a TPK and to teach the players to act cautiously and make wise decisions. In the ritual chamber, the cult is no longer willing to accept the sacrifice of a beast (e.g., Lancelot), foreshadowing that Strahd will not be content with Ireena alone. The **shambling mound** has been replaced by a two-stage **flesh mound**, whose statistics have been calibrated to provide a challenging fight without risking a TPK.

***Escape From Death House.*** The original "escape from Death House" sequence has been replaced with a pair of social encounters that reward the players for investigating the history of the house, and which serve to foreshadow the characterizations of Sergi von Zarovich, Lady Fiona Wachter, and Strahd's brides and servants in the adventure to come.

The frequent community addition of a skill challenge to escape the house has been removed to ensure a smooth and simple transition from the flesh mound's death to the players' exit from the house, to remove any friction with players who may struggle to learn the mechanics of a new system of gameplay in the heat of the moment, and to preserve the players' immersion in the narrative of the escape, rather than its gameplay.

This guide has intentionally foregone a popular community addition that places a bottle of wine—courtesy of Strahd—at or near the exit of the house. Strahd is not omniscient, and the players' efforts to avoid or foil his spies will prove a recurring aspect of gameplay through the adventure. Moreover, Death House is too far from Barovia proper for Strahd to have obtained and delivered a fresh bottle of wine to its location. A villain is only as evocative as their limitations, and Strahd has many. 

Finally, it is an intentional design choice of this guide that the players do not encounter Strahd directly until their meeting at the River Ivlis Crossroads, which ensures that their relationship with Strahd before then is built solely on rumor, second-hand knowledge, and superstition. Earlier direct exposure would wholly spoil this effect.
