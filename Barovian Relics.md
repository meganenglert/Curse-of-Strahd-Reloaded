# Knowledge—The Amber Shard
![[ images/Amber Shard.png]]  
A player seeking **knowledge** begins the campaign with the *amber shard*, a small chunk of amber resin mounted on a chain-link cord. The shard is inset with complex, three-dimensional arcane runes. When viewed under the *detect magic* spell, it exudes a strong aura of abjuration magic.

Unbeknownst to the player, the *amber shard* was formerly a part of a dark vestige's amber sarcophagus in the Amber Temple in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, it glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the *amber shard* should have strong, vivid reasons to want to unlock its secrets and the magic that it possesses.

***Developments.*** In **Act I, Arc A: Escape From Death House**, the player recognizes Elisabeth Durst's *amber shard* as similar in appearance to their own. In [[ Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc H - The Strazni Siblings]], the player recognizes Izek Strazni's *amber shard* in a similar way. In *Act V, Arc U*, Elder Burebis of Soldav can recognize the *amber shard* as a shard of evil taken from the Amber Temple, and the player can recognize the *amber shards* kept by the **shoosuva** and **bodaks** as resembling their own. 

If the player character is reduced to 0 hit points in Barovia while in possession of their *amber shard*, it behaves as described in **Appendix B: The Amber Shards,** offering the player an opportunity to forge a pact with a vestige of the Amber Temple that fits the player character's personality, flaws, and temptations. Upon entering the Amber Temple, the player's *amber shard* glows and tugs in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, guiding the player toward a suitable amber sarcophagus.

# Redemption—The Angel's Feather
![[ images/Angel's Feather.png]]  
A player seeking **redemption** begins the campaign with the *angel's feather*, a large, snow-white feather. When viewed beneath the light of the morning sun, the feather's barbs glimmer like gold.

Unbeknownst to the player, the *angel's feather* formerly belonged to Lumiel, a **deva** that serves the god Lathander, who is known to his followers as the Morninglord. Lumiel is the true name of the Abbot, who dwells in the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.

The player who possesses the *angel's feather* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will one day lead them to penance for the sins that they have committed.

***Developments.*** When the players first arrive at the Abbey in **Act IV, Arc N: The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind** or **Act IV, Arc Q: A Bride for Strahd**, the *angel's feather* glimmers and is swept away in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, guiding the player toward the Abbot. The Abbot recognizes the feather as his own, but dismisses its importance.

# Family—The Wanderer's Scarf
![[ images/Wanderer's Scarf.png]]  
A player seeking **family** begins the campaign with the *wanderer's scarf*, a multicolored scarf woven with complex patterns. The fabric is soft and warm, and is long enough to be worn around the neck or over one's head. When bright sunlight, moonlight, or starlight is allowed to pass through it, the patterns seem to shimmer and twist in eerie and beautiful ways.

Unbeknownst to the player, the *wanderer's scarf* once belonged to a Vistana who left their caravan and settled down to marry the one they loved. The scarf was a parting gift from the caravan's leader—a reminder of the joys that the Vistana had experienced while traveling. When it senses the presence of Death House, the scarf is carried away by a warm, playful breeze, its patterns shifting and turning in the air, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.

The player who possesses the *wanderer's scarf* should have received the scarf from a beloved family member, and should have strong, vivid reasons to long for a sense of family and belonging.

***Developments.*** When the players first encounter Ezmerelda in **Act IV, Arc M: Strahd's Enemy** or **Act IV, Arc N: The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind**, the *wanderer's scarf* shimmers and is carried away in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, landing at Ezmerelda's feet. Ezmerelda recognizes the scarf and, upon confirming how the player came to inherit it, greets the player as family, calling them "cousin."

# Inheritance—The Dragon's Scale
![[ images/Dragon's Scale.png]]  
A player seeking **inheritance** begins the campaign with the *dragon's scale*, a large silver scale that always feels cold to the touch. A Good-aligned creature that touches the scale feels a fleeting sense of safety, protection, and comfort.

Unbeknownst to the player, the *dragon's scale* formerly belonged to Argynvost, the **adult silver dragon** who founded the Order of the Silver Dragon. The order's headquarters, the mansion of Argynvostholt, can be found in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the scale burns with an icy cold, one end glowing with a bright, silver light in the direction of the house. While the scale glows in this way, a Good-aligned creature that touches it feels a deep sense of longing, loss, and hope.

The player who possesses the *dragon's scale* should have received the scale from a family member, and should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the scale will one day unlock the secrets of their heritage.

***Developments.*** When the player first encounters Argynvost's shadow in the foyer of Argynvostholt in **Act IV, Arc O: The Beacon of Argynvostholt**, the scale briefly burns cold in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House. Each time the player approaches a manifestation of Argynvost's spirit, the scale burns cold and glows with a bright, silver light in the direction of the manifestation. 

If the player helps to retrieve Argynvost's skull and restore it to his crypt, Argynvost's spirit greets the player warmly, naming them his heir to the legacy of the Order of the Silver Dragon before lighting the beacon of Argynvostholt.

# Wealth—The Electrum Coin
![[ images/Electrum Coin.png]]  
A player seeking **wealth** begins the campaign with an old, chipped *electrum coin* stamped with the profiled visage of a proud, yet cold-looking nobleman. When seen in a certain light, the nobleman's expression seems to change from a firm, aristocratic sneer to a feral, monstrous snarl.

Unbeknownst to the player, the visage stamped upon the *electrum coin* is the face of Strahd von Zarovich, the undead ruler of Barovia. The coin was minted long ago, but spirited away from Strahd's treasuries by a thief shortly before Barovia was lost to the mists. When it senses the presence of Death House, the coin lands on its edge, then begins rolling across the ground toward the house until it reaches the base of its steps.

The player who possesses the *electrum coin* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the coin first came from a wondrous vault of treasure—a conqueror's hoard—and that, one day, it will lead them to claim riches beyond imagining.

***Developments.*** Any Barovian immediately recognizes the visage stamped upon the coin as Strahd's. If the player shares the coin's story with one of the Vistani of Madam Eva's camp in [[ Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley]], Sir Godfrey Gwilym in **Act IV, Arc O: The Beacon of Argynvostholt**, or Kasimir Velikov in **Act V, Arc U: The Amber Temple**, they can learn of Strahd's vast hoard of treasure, collected in his days as a conqueror and hidden away in Castle Ravenloft. 

When the player first approaches Strahd's treasury, the coin lands on its edge and rolls as far as it can toward the treasury's entrance, in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House.

# Healing—The Wolf's Tooth
![[ images/Wolf's Tooth.png]]  
A player seeking **healing** begins the campaign with a *wolf's tooth* coated with clear resin and mounted on a leather cord. The tooth seems to lengthen and sharpen on nights of the full moon, and calms its wearer's dreams when worn at night.

Unbeknownst to the player, the tooth once belonged to a wolfir—a **werewolf** that served the fey goddess known as the Huntress before her gift of lycanthropy was twisted into a curse. The Huntress's holy place, the Forest Fane, dwells amidst the woodlands of Barovia, silently waiting to be restored. When it senses the presence of Death House, the tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the *wolf's tooth* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the tooth is the key to curing a particular wound, malady, or curse that ails them.

***Developments.*** If the player shows the *wolf's tooth* to Kavan in **Act III, Arc K: The Missing Gem** or to Elder Burebis in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the tooth is recognized as an artifact and symbol of the Huntress. When the player first approaches the circle of stones at the Forest Fane in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the tooth lengthens and glows with moonlight as it did upon sensing Death House.

# Duty—The Raven's Feather
![[ images/Raven's Feather.png]]  
A player seeking **duty** begins the campaign with a *raven's feather*, a small, black feather with soft, downy barbs. When held aloft before a storm, the feather seems to gently tremble, exuding the scent of cold rain and damp earth.

Unbeknownst to the player, the feather once belonged to the **roc** of Mount Ghakis, a servant of the fey goddess known as the Seeker, whose Mountain Fane rests in the shadow of Mount Ghakis in Barovia. The roc once enjoyed disguising itself as a common raven, and shed this feather on one such occasion. When it senses the presence of Death House, the feather is swept away by an unseen and violent wind, the scent of rain and ozone filling the air, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.

The player who possesses the *raven's feather* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will always guide them to those who need aid, protection, and comfort.

***Developments.*** If the player shows the *raven's feather* to Madam Eva in [[ Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley]], she inspects it reverently and returns it to the player, claiming mysteriously that she once knew the bird that shed it. If the player shows the feather to Urwin Martikov, Danika Dorakova, Muriel Vinshaw, or any other member of the Keepers of the Feather, that member grows warmer and friendlier toward that player. 

When the player first enters the circle of standing stones at the Mountain Fane in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the feather trembles and the air around it briefly grows thick with the scent of rain and ozone as it did upon sensing Death House. If the player shows the feather to the Roc of Mount Ghakis after consecrating the Mountain Fane in the same arc, the roc places the tip of its beak against the player's forehead as a sign of gratitude and approval before departing.

# Power—The Crumpled Page
![[ images/Crumpled Page.png]]  
A player seeking **power** begins the campaign with the *crumpled page*, an old, yellowed page that was torn from its book long ago. The page is written in strange and cryptic arcane runes; those few runes that can be decoded speak of a path that leads to immortality and untold power.

Unbeknownst to the player, the page was taken from the library of Exethanter, a **lich** who dwells in the deepest sanctum of the Amber Temple in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that leads to the house.

The player who possesses the *crumpled page* should have strong, vivid reasons to want to find and claim the power that the page promises.

***Developments.*** When the player first approaches Exethanter's library in **Act V, Arc U: The Amber Temple**, the ink glows with amber light as it did upon sensing Death House, and the runes reshape themselves into a map of Exethanter's chambers and nearby access points. If the player shows the page to Exethanter after restoring his memories in the same arc, Exethanter grows warmer and friendlier toward that player.

# Ambition—The Tattered Banner
![[ images/Tattered Banner.png]]  
A player seeking **ambition** begins the campaign with the *tattered banner*, an old, ragged red banner bearing the heraldry of a raven in front of a shield. The raven's wings are spread wide, and the shield has the image of a castle's keep engraved into its top. Sometimes, when a Lawful-aligned creature holds the banner, a crimson light seems to glimmer from the peak of the castle's keep, and the sound of soldiers marching can be distantly heard.

Unbeknownst to the player, the banner was once flown by the warlord Strahd von Zarovich in the days before he became a vampire and was trapped within the mists of Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the distant sound of war-drums fills its holder's ears and the banner blows in an unseen wind, pulling toward the house's direction.

The player who possesses the *tattered banner* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the banner was once the sigil of a mighty conqueror—and that, by following in that conqueror's steps, they will one day achieve greatness, glory, and the right to rule.

***Developments.*** When the player first experiences the haunted battlefield north of Berez in **Act V, Arc T: Baba Lysaga's Revenge** or **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the banner flaps in the wind, which echoes with the sound of war-drums. 

If the player shows the banner to the revenant at Tser Falls in [[ Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley]], Sir Godfrey Gwilym or Sir Vladimir Horngaard in **Act IV, Arc O: The Beacon of Argynvostholt**, or Kasimir Velikov in either **Act V, Arc U: The Amber Temple** or **Act IV, Arc M: Strahd's Enemy**, its appearance is met with revulsion and bitter disgust. 

If the player shows the banner to Strahd, he regards it with fond thoughtfulness, but declines to elaborate on its significance. If the player shows the banner to Dr. Rudolph van Richten in **Arc M: Strahd's Enemy** or any Vistani, they immediately recognize it as the heraldry of Castle Ravenloft.

# Faith—The Sunrise Medallion
![[ images/Sunrise Medallion.png]]  
A player seeking **faith** begins the campaign with the *sunrise medallion*, a bronze disc engraved with the image of a rising sun. The disc glitters like gold when exposed to the light of the sunrise, and a Good-aligned creature that touches it feels a fleeting sense of reverence, righteousness, and peace.

Unbeknownst to the player, the medallion once belonged to Sergei von Zarovich, the brother of Strahd von Zarovich and an acolyte of the Church of the Morninglord who was once expected to become its Most High Priest. When it senses the presence of Death House, the medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, the rays of sunlight emanating from the engraved sun pointing in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the *sunrise medallion* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that it will strengthen or guide them in faith, and that certain signs of the divine will lead them to those in need of salvation and deliverance.

***Developments.*** When the player first approaches St. Andral's Church in [[ Act II - The Shadowed Town/Arc D - The Tome of Strahd]], the *sunrise medallion* glows and shines in the direction of the church's doors. If the player shows the *sunrise medallion* to Father Donavich or Lucian, they recognize it as a symbol of the Church of the Morninglord and grow warmer and friendlier toward that player.

# Harmony—The Stone Crest
![[ images/Stone Crest.png]]  
A player seeking **harmony** begins the campaign with the *stone crest*, a flat, round stone engraved with the image of a three-pointed star. On the nights of the new moon, the star seems to glimmer with emerald light.

Unbeknownst to the player, the crest once belonged to a spiritual leader among the First Folk, the people who first settled the land of Barovia long ago, and who have now divided into the Forest Folk (who are loyal to Strahd) and the Mountain Folk (who are not). The engravings upon it depict the symbols of the Seeker, the Weaver, and the Huntress—the three fey goddesses that the First Folk once called the *Rozana*, or Ladies Three. When it senses the presence of Death House, the crest emits a low hum and releases a scent of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger as the player approaches the house.

The player who possesses the *stone crest* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the symbols upon it represent a primal or divine power of harmony and nature, and that the crest can aid them in restoring the sanctity of wild places.

***Developments.*** When the player first approaches the exterior of Soldav in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the *stone crest* hums and releases a scent of pine needles and earth soil as it did upon sensing Death House, both of which grow stronger as the player approaches the Shrine of the Rozana in Soldav. 

If the player shows the *stone crest* to Kavan in **Act III, Arc K: The Missing Gem** or to Elder Burebis in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the crest is recognized as an artifact and symbol of the Ladies of the Fanes. 

# Justice—The Broken Blade
![[ images/Broken Blade.png]]  
A player seeking **justice** begins the campaign with the *broken blade*, the shattered tip of an elven longsword. The blade is engraved with the sigil of a lion rampant, which seems to roar when the light of dusk touches it.

Unbeknownst to the player, the blade once belonged to Erevan, a dusk elf prince. Erevan, a master bladesinger, practiced the style of the lion, which he also used as his personal sigil. However, Erevan refused to pay tribute to King Barov von Zarovich, a powerful warlord and the father of Strahd von Zarovich. 

Rahadin, a dusk elf who had spurned Erevan's rule, helped King Barov conquer the dusk elf kingdom. Rahadin then broke Erevan's blade and personally executed Erevan and his family as punishment for his defiance. When it senses the presence of Death House, the blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the *broken blade* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that their ancestors were refugees, driven forth from their ancestral lands and persecuted, and that the blade will one day deliver justice to the traitor who destroyed them.

***Developments.*** If the player shows the *broken blade* to Kasimir Velikov in **Act V, Arc U: The Amber Temple**, he mournfully recalls its history and asks the player how they came to possess it. If the player informs Kasimir of how they came to inherit it, Kasimir greets them as family, wondering aloud if more of the dusk elves may have escaped Strahd's slaughter outside of Barovia.

If the *broken blade* is ever in close proximity to Rahadin, Strahd's chamberlain, it emits a high-pitched hum and trembles violently, spinning like a compass needle in his direction just as it did upon sensing Death House. If the player shows the *broken blade* to Rahadin, he at first claims to have no memory of it, noting dispassionately the thousands that he has slaughtered. However, in combat, Rahadin eventually comes to remember the blade's origins, dismissing it as "the shattered toy of a weak and worthless man."
